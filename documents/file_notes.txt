*ARO General Notes:
*  Watershed dates:  ACF fitting routines changed from FACF to MRACF as of May
*  85 and the Barker program changed (to a software decoder) as of Sep 86.
*  Both MRACF and the Barker software decoder are currently used (Jun 94).
*  Jun 94:  Arecibo plans to reanalyze their contributions to the database
*  (CEDAR Post, Feb 94, p 9).  Debate over some results such as Te/Ti < 1
*  and a post midnight maximum, has catalyzed an improved analysis procedure.
*  This will be applied systematically to the most recent experiments first
*  then back in time.  There is hope that some missing experiments from 78-80
*  will be recovered at the same time and there is disussion of adding the
*  raw ACF data.
**
*  (Jun 95) ACF data have been replaced for world day runs from Jan 90 through
*  May 95.  The KINDAT code for this analysis is 2010.  The procedure is
*  given in "Analysis of the Arecibo World Day Data, October 1985 to May
*  1995", (Draft June 1995) by M. Sulzer; printed copies may be requested by
*  sending email to me (bozo@ucar.edu).  On 25 Sep 95, it was discovered
*  that all of these data are in local time; ADD 4 HRS TO CORRECT TO UT!  (An
*  edit is forthcoming.)
*  (Jan 96) The reanalysis LT to UT edits are complete and ACF data have been
*  replaced back to October 85, except for experiments retained in ARO85111A,
*  three 1991 experiments (10 Jul, 10-11 Sep, 7-9 Oct), and Barker electron
*  density profiles for all periods.  Those interested in the 1991 ACF
*  experiments should contact zhou@naic.edu because there are problems with
*  the current reanalysis of these three periods.
*  (May 96) The two previously omitted Barker sets have been reinstated
*  because the reanalysis does not affect the results.
*  (Jun 97) Mike Sulzer provided the following descriptions of data
*  reduction procedures for removing sattelite effects and calibrating
*  electron densities.  These are apropos data starting October 1985.
**
*  Satellites:
*  Large spikes that appear once in the spectra are removed fairly easily
*  because we transmit seven frequencies at once, and any large deviation
*  from that repeating pattern can be detected.  Satellites are not so
*  much of a problem with Arecibo WD data because we have such a strong
*  signal and there are not so many of them.  Sometimes they go through
*  undectected and some of the outliers that appear in our data are
*  undoubtedly due to satellites.  Other forms of interference are far
*  more serious.
**
*  Electron Density Calibration:
*  This is a somehwat difficult and time consuming problem.  Here is the
*  procedure we are using.
*  A good ionosonde reading is found near the beginning of a radar run,
*  but after intitial adjustments to the radar, etc are complete.  A
*  scale factor is derived which results in the correct electron density
*  coming out of the fitting process at this time.  The data for this run
*  are fit using this factor. (A run might be a 24 hour period or a
*  multiple day period if continuous.) Then a parabola is fit to the peak
*  of each profile to give an accurate interpolated value of the pasma
*  frequency at the peak and the height at which it occurs.  Then all of
*  the ionosonde values for that run are typed into the computer. (In the
*  future they will be on disk or tape already.) The ionosonde values are
*  plotted on the same graph and compared with the estimates from the
*  radar; bad ionogram readings are ignored.  Corrections to the radar
*  data based on the good ionogram measurements are made by pointing and
*  clicking on the graph.  If the corrections are small or we are near
*  solar max when the electron densities are very high, this ends the
*  procedure.  However, if the corrections are large, and the densities
*  small, then the temperatures migh be in error due to the Debye length
*  factor.  In these cases (which are in the minority), a set of scale
*  factors are generated and the data are refit.

*  These are meridional neutral winds data.  They were prepared by SRI for Ray
*  Roble and Barb Emery (Jun 87); SRI refers to this as a WINDPORT tape.  No
*  header record was provided but a number of caveats were mentioned in the
*  cover letter accompanying the tape:
*   (1) Vector velocities were derived from line of sight observations, also
*       calculated were average density and temperature profiles.
*   (2) The line-of-sight velocities were corrected for transmitter chirp in
*       consultation with Arecibo personnel.
*   (3) The uncertainties for Arecibo velocity data are arbitrary, not real.
*   (4) No error bars were used for the densities, temperatures and their
*       derivatives.
*   (5) MSIS 83 neutral densities were also used to calculate neutral winds.
*   (6) In calculating the winds, the Schunk and Walker (1973) O+O-collision
*       frequency was multiplied by 1.7.
*   (7) About using the data (by Vince Wickwar):  Data he has presented were
*       smoothed by 1-hr running averages.  Sometimes there was also averaging
*       over a limited altitude region.  Although the meridional wind was
*       calculated to high altitudes, values are dubious above about 350 km.
*       In general the data are valid between the lowest altitude with good
*       signal to noise ratio and about 400 km.  Above 400 km the radar data
*       may be contaminated by hydrogen, the SNR is low, and the correction
*       for ion-neutral collision frequencies is enormous.  When using the
*       meridional winds, values are dropped when uncertainties exceed
*       70 m/s at Arecibo.

*CHT General Notes:
*  The Chatanika ISR was moved to become the Sondre Stromfjord ISR in 1982.
*  Some chatanika data volumes have no header records, including a set of
*  six volume ([Ewinds or VPORT] X [summer,winter,equinox]).  The following
*  notes accompanied the summer experiments and may be generally helpful:
*   - These are data from program VAST.
*   - Please note that the F10.7 parameters in the VAST output records with
*     KINDAT of 5103 have been assigned the wrong code values.  F10.7 solar flux
*     (SA) 81 day average was given the code of 351.  F10.7 of the previous day
*     day was given the code of 352.  The units are 1/E-22W/m2/Hz.
*   - VAST calculates electric fields, vector velocities and conductivities.
*     VAST assumes the velocity field varies linearly with time.  Data from five
*     positions are used to find the three line-of-sight velocities at the time
*     of the middle observation.  Full error propagation, including covariance
*     terms, is included.  The density and temperature data are combined to
*     obtain a spatial average for the time of the middle observation.
*       In addition, several criterea involving the least squares fit, as well
*     as relative absolute uncertainties, have been examined to determine
*     whether the derived F-region vector velocities are converted to electric
*     fields, and the good values are height integrated to find the best possible
*     estimate of the electric field.  Starting in the D-region, the averaged
*     electron densities are used to calculate the conductivities.  The
*     calculation has been improved to explicitly include the ion-neutral
*     collision frequencies and to include a model atmosphere.
*   - Since there are no headers, the KINDAT codes (identifying record type)
*     and various parameter codes used are as follows:
*     BASIC PARAMETERS:
*      Inputs to VAST from the center position.
*         KINDAT = 5100, 5101, 5102 -- Power channel data, including our best
*                                      estimate of the electron density.
*      Outputs from VAST.  The times are those of the center position.
*         KINDAT = 5103 -- Power channel data, including the averaged temperatures
*                          densities and the conductivities.
*      DERIVED PARAMETERS:
*          KINDAT = 15013 -- OAC (old autocorreltor data) data from VAST.
*                   15014 -- MAC data
*      PARAMETER CODES:

*EIS General Notes
*  Regarding ACF zero lags for EISCAT analyses performed before Sep 86.
*  Occasionally values for this field were incorrectly represented as
*  negatives when values larger than allowed in 16 bits were assigned.  If
*  using this field, see Roy B for a procedure to recover these erroneous
*  data (EISCAT memo dated 10 Oct 86 from Walter Schmidt).
**
*  Volumes with the suffix 'B' for all experiments through Oct 93 are a
*  subset of the 'A' version.  Catalogue records and power profile records
*  are omitted, leaving only ACF height profiles.  In these records, the
*  ACF values (real and imaginary at 33 lags) have been removed, thus
*  reducing MPAR to 28 (from 94).
**
*  All CP-3-E and CP-3-F experiments KINDAT = 6310 and 6312) from
*  27 Jan 87 to 20 Mar 91 used the wrong correlator program causing
*  artificially broadened spectrum and an underestimated doppler
*  shift.  Estimates of induced errors obtained by alternating between
*  correct and wrong correlator programs, indicate ion temperature
*  overestimated by 10-20% and the ion velocity underestimated by a
*  similar amount when doppler shifts are moderate (several hundred m/s).
*  Further details may be obtained from EISCAT scientific staff.

*  A number of problems led to loss/corruption of significant amounts of data
*  during this experiment:
*  (1) At some time between 1420 and 1440 UT on September 21, the frequency
*      of one of the two long pulses changed from F12 to F15; the problem was
*      noticed around noon 23 Sep and corrected at 1205 (Tromso), 1120 (Kiruna)
*      and 1140 (Sodankyla).  A factor of 2 was included in the system constant
*      (effectively doubling derived densities) for analysis of the following
*      periods:      Tromso: 1440 Sep 21 - 1205 Sep 23
*                    Kiruna: 1430 Sep 21 - 1120 Sep 23
*                 Sodankyla: 1430 Sep 21 - 1140 Sep 23
*  (2) The transmitter was off between 1934 Sep 21 and 0726 Sep 22; restart
*      was okay as of 0837.
*  (3) A hardware problem caused a high system temperature in the long pulse
*      data from 1948 Sep 22 to 0829 Sep 23.  Efforts were made to salvage
*      as much data as possible, however, some long pulse densities may be in
*      error around 1430 Sep 21 and 1130 Sep 23 (the latter for remote sites
*      only).  Also results for 1948 Sep 22 to 0830 Sep 23 contain some obvious
*      errors and maybe some hidden ones.

*  The CP-4-A program is designed to study high latitude convection.  The radar
*  points at a low elevation to the north and swings between two azimuths with
*  nominal dwell time of 150 seconds in each position and a cycle time of 5
*  minutes.  Tristatic data are recorded, though the three antenna beams are
*  not too far off parallel, and the usual post processing of velocities is to
*  combine the pairs of Tromso results from the two azimuths to obtain the
*  horizontal component of velocity.  This experiment makes identical
*  measurements on six different frequencies, and the results for each time
*  interval on the tape consist of the average of the six measurements,
*  followed by the six sets of individual results, which can be used for self-
*  consistency checks.  Two gaps in experiment:  1630-1730UT on the 14th and
*  17-21UT on the 15th due to an interruption for a diffferent experiment.

*  CP 5 A is a new experiment type, essentially a scanning CP 1 H experiment
*  with the pointing geometry taken from the central part of the CP 3 F scan.
*  The start ranges and range-resolutions of the measurements are adjusted by
*  using different radar controller programs for the different antenna
*  positions, in the same way as CP 3 F.  The 30-min scan includes a longer
*  (10 min) dwell in the field aligned position to allow the remote sites to
*  take E-region measurements (at 96, 101, 109, and 120 km) as well as at the
*  F-region commmon volume height (278 km) which is used for all other scan
*  positions.
*  This experiment was almost trouble free.  Two gaps:  1900-1910 UT on 5 Dec
*  due to a crowbar and 2200-2250 due to a change of experiment to support a
*  rocket launch.  Note the experiment was restarted at 2250 UT so the scans
*  for the rest of the experiment were not synchronised to whole hours.
*  Anyone planning to analyse the Tromso CP 5 data for themselves should note
*  a small error in the :ELAN file which caused the wrong start range for the
*  high resolution (14 micros) power profile for the vertical antenna position
*  to be written to the parameter blocks on the raw data tapes.  A value of 884
*  (88.4 km) was written instead of the correct value of 664 (66.4 km).  The
*  correct value has been used for the ranges on the present result tapes.

*  CP-3-F (KINDAT= 6311 and 6312).  A receiver recovery problem in Tromso
*  persisted through this experiment, with the effect that the zero lag of the
*  ACF's was too small and that the background noise varied with range for the
*  power profile measurements.  The data were analysed using extrapolation
*  methods to obtain the zero lags and to correct the range-dependent noise.
*  Hence the results, in particular the power profiles, should be used with
*  care!

*  The Tromso antenna problems seem to have affected the pointing accuracy
*  after 21 UT 1 June.  The remote sites observed that the strongest signal
*  was not always centered at the expected range but varied systematically thru
*  each 30 minute cycle.  For scan positions close to the vertical in Tromso
*  there was little effect on the data but the signal at the remotes gradually
*  drifted from the expected signal gate for lower transmitter elevations.  The
*  remote site data have been analysed in the standard way, which assumes the
*  true signal to be in the center gate.  Hence the derived remote-site
*  electron densities show a steep gradient outwards from the center of the

*  the associated uncertainties are larger than would have been the case in
*  in normal operation.
*  Additional remarks (received with Aug 89 data):  This version of the
*  experiment was the same as run in December 1988.  Both contained a small
*  error in the Tromso :ELAN file, such that the start range for the 14 us
*  power profile in the vertiacl antenna position was set to 88.4 instead of
*  66.4 km.  This parameter (I19 in the :ELAN file) is put in position 124 in
*  the parameter block on the raw data tapes.  The analysis of the December run
*  was modified to use the correct start range (68.4 km) for these data but
*  this modification was not implemented for the May/June run.  Hence, the
*  values (altitudes and densities) on the result tapes for the short power
*  profile in the vertical antenna position for this run are wrong and should
*  not be used.
*  Further erroneous information has been diescovered in the :DESC and Tromso
*  :TLAN files which has similarly been inherited from the original SP-FR-LCCP
*  files.  This affects neither the raw data nor the processed results but
*  could cause confusion.  The commented start ranges for radar controller
*  program 5 are wrong in these files and have been corrected on 10 October
*  1989 (as was the 68.4 km start range mentioned above).  These values are

*  CP-4-A (KINDAT= 6402).  A GITCAD/SUNDIAL campaign.  Data from the start of
*  the experiment to 0911 UT 3 Oct were reanalyzed from tape due to the wrongly
*  recorded azimuth.
*  The original version of CP-4-A, run Jan 1988, was adapeted for this
*  operation to include the possibility of shifting the ranges covered by the
*  measurements, by increments of one gate.  The idea was to to collect data
*  from further north if a significant signal was detected in the last gate.
*  This option was implemented at 1630 UT 2 Oct, when the range of the first
*  signal gate was increased from 525 to 600 km.  The start range of the
*  measurements is given by parameter I18, contained in position 123 in the
*  parameter block on the raw data tapes (see :ELAN file).  Electron densities
*  were sufficiently high during this experiment that the SNR threshold of 0%
*  in the data analysis was rarely approached.
*  The remote sites were able to receive only five of the six frequencies used
*  in this experiment - channel 5, planned to receive F5, was attenuated with
*  63 dB.  However, the format of the results on the tapes has been kept the
*  same for all sites, i.e., the results of averaging all chanels appear first
*  for each post-integration, followed by the results from the six individual
*  channels.  Hence the results from channel 5 at the remotes are all zero.
*  The raw data from channel 5 were not used to construct the averaged results
*  at the remote sites.
*  The averaged results have been assigned a frequency code of 9325 (not used
*  in the experiment) to allow them to be easily selected from the tape
*  (applies to all sites).
*  For Kiruna, site, the apparent velocities from channel 8, receiving F2
*  (fequency code 9305) were approximately zero from the start of the
*  experiment until 15 UT 3 Oct, due to a fault in the receiver causing the
*  imaginary part of the ACF to be very small in that channel (in fact, no
*  signal but constant offset voltage for the sine component).  No obvious
*  effect was seen in the real part of the ACF.  Since these data were included
*  in the production of the average results, the averaged velocities are less
*  well estimated for the affected period, though with no systematic bias from

*  the interval 0222-0229 Oct 8 when data recording failed to restart after
*  a change of disc set.  Post-integrated results are available.
*  Close inspection of the original results from this experiment revealed that
*  the zero-lags of the Tromso ACF's were slightly too large in all channels.
*  This was only evident during the intervals with small signal levels (~few
*  %), which were mainly confined to the night of 7-8 Oct.  To overcome this
*  problem, the data were re-analyzed using values for the zero lags obtained
*  by parabolic extrapolation from lag two and lag one.  The results on tape
*  are from this modified analysis.
*  The diurnal pattern of positive excursions of system temperature during
*  this experiment are due to excess sky noise.  The sharp decreases and slow
*  increases back to nominal levels between 2230 Oct 7 and 1230 Oct 8 are due
*  to the behavior of the noise injection.
*  One further detail is that two of the frequency codes in the Sodankyla
*  results have been assigned the valus 8275 and 8315 instead of 9275 and
*  9315 respectively, due to an error in the computer readback of the

*  CP-4-A (KINDAT= 6402).  Almost problem-free apart from a small number of
*  crowbars and high voltage trips.  However, the transmitter experienced a
*  large number of cases of high reflected power after 1730 Dec 5, attributable
*  to fequency F6 (930.5 MHz).  In an effort to cure this, F6 was changed at
*  1809 to F3 but with no improvement; subsequently, F2 and F9 were tried
*  with no change, but at 1824 a change to F10 (932.5 MHz) helped, so this
*  configuration remained to the end of the experiment.  By coincidence,
*  this (previously unused) frequency corresponds to the code (9325) on the
*  result tape which is used to identify the results from the average of all
*  the channels in each post-integration period.  Thus from 1824 there are
*  two sets of results with this code for any given time; the first is the
*  average as before, while the last is from measurements at F10.
*  At 1830 Dec 7 the radar controller program was changed by issuing the
*  command "GOTO BLOCK 4".  This changes the start range of the first gate
*  from 525 km to 600 km; i.e., it moves all gates further out by the
*  equivalent of one gate.  These revised ranges were maintained until the

*  CP-1-I (KINDAT= 6117,6118).  This experiment directly followed a 3 day CP-4

*  experiment.
*  Sodankyla experienced software problems when initially starting CP-1 and
*  eventually had to reload some real-time programs, joining in the operation
*  at 1100 (50 minutes late).
*  A curious feature was observed in the Kiruna data during this experiment,
*  namely a coherent-type signal in the first two gates for E-region positions.
*  Five signal gates are sampled for remote station CP-1 measurements; the
*  timing is adjusted so that the strongest true signal is in the center (3rd)
*  gate while some spillover is seen in gates 2 and 4.  The unwanted coherent
*  signal, thought to arise from tropospheric scatter, was strongest in gate
*  one for the highest E region altitides (125 and 117 km) and strongest in
*  gate 2 for the lowest altitudes (90 and 96 km).  For the intermediate

*  seen in gate 1 at 124 km were ~2-3% with intermittent spikes reaching 100-

*  used without careful checking of the raw data, which may help identify
*  uncontaminated periods for detailed studies.  Neither Kiruna F-region data
*  nor Sodankyla measurements were affected by this feature.

*  CP-1-J (KINDAT= 6119,6120).  CP-1-J is the new version of common program 1,
*  the main difference being the replacement of the multipulse scheme by one
*  using alternation codes for E- and lower F-region measurements.
*  Additionally, the number of power profile gates is changed.  Both
*  alternating code pulses and long pulses are received at the remote sites,
*  resulting in two sets of ACF results for each post-integration interval.
*  Antenna pointing is identical with CP-1-I.  Further details can be found in
*  the description files on the tape.
*  The particular combination of frequencies used for the different pulse
*  schemes during this operation resulted in occasional contamination of the
*  high resolution power profile measurements by plasma line echoes from the
*  long pulse transmission.  This is most evident as excess power at the
*  shortest ranges where true ionospheric scatter is expected to be
*  negligable.  While it is recommended to use these results with great care,
*  there are periods of uncontaminated data which can be cross-checked for
*  validity with the medium resolution power profile results.  The latter
*  cover altitudes above 68.7 km, compared with 62.2 km for the power profiles
*  (and 86.8 km for the alternating code data) which have been used in the
*  analysis are sightly lower than the original estimates for SP-EI-ALTCP1
*  which were included in the symbolic files when this experiment was run.
*  These original files were included on the tape, as well as the revised
*  :GDEF and :DESC files where these changes are noted.
*  The transmitter was turned off 0740-0813 Apr 2 to allow investigations into
*  the apparent excess power in the power profile data, but raw data from
*  Tromso are missing anyway for 0513-0900 due to an error in data recording
*  following a change of disc set.  However, results from an initial analysis
*  of data integrated in real time are available for this interval and are
*  appended as the final Tromso data files for this experiment (3 files
*  04-10 UT).  Note that the electron densities from the preliminary analysis
*  were 20 % higher than the correctly scaled ones of the final analyis;
*  the electron temperatures from the 0513-0900 interval are thus
*  underestimated.  The start ranges of the two power profiles and the
*  alternating code results in this interval are slightly larger than the values
*  used in the subsequent analysis of the rest of the data set, as noted above.
*  Data are missing from Kiruna for 14-16 UT on the same day due to an
*  antenna problem.
*  The frequency of one of the second local oscillators in Tromso became
*  changed from its nominal value following a crowbar at 1116 UT Mar 31.  This
*  resulted in an apparent decrease of electron density and increased variance
*  in the results from the alternating code scheme (as well as reduced densities
*  from the high resolution power profile) until the frequency was corrected
*  at 1200 UT.

*  results appeared after this time, either in single gates or in whole
*  profiles for a single post-integration period.  The cause of these gaps
*  is due to digital errors producing a spike in a single 10-sec dump,
*  occurring on average a few times per hour.  Whole profiles are affected
*  if the spike appeared in that part of the dump containing either the
*  background or calibration gates.  These spikes appear to be single data

*  be screened out by a suitably designed algorithm to provide a more
*  complete set of results.  This process has not been implemented in this

*  CP-4-B (KINDAT= 6404).  Version B is similar to CP-4-A, designed to measure
*  high geomagnetic latitude ion velocities, but it differs significantly in
*  method of operation.  CP-4-B is a VHF experiment, measuring from two different
*  azimuths via a split-beam geometry.  Two panels of the VHF antenna (Kinst=74)
*  are phased at 344.7 degrees azimuth, so there are simultaneous observations
*  along both azimuths, rather than successive as in CP-4-A.
*  Three frequencies are commutated to provide a single set of ACF's and power
*  profiles for both beams in the same data dump in CP-4-B.  The results on the
*  tape have been formatted such that the derived parameters from each beam
*  direction are in separate logical records for each post-integration
*  interval (150 sec).  Thus, there are two logical records for each interval
*  which differ in 1D azimuth values.  Results for the phased beam constitute
*  the first of each pair of records; this can be inferred from the latitudes
*  and longitudes of the gate positions.  As a further aid to separating the
*  results, the frequency codes are uniquely assigned (2232 for phased and
*  2234 for unphased).  Only ACF results are included although power profiles
*  are measured with this experiment, the results showed some systematic
*  features (not of ionospheric origin) which are still being investigated.
*  A further note about the raw data:  The codes defining the azimuth of
*  the phased beam in the parameter block were reset to zero at 0902 UT 24
*  Nov even though the azimuth remained constant.

*  Even though the UHF high voltage was kept comparatively low because of
*  known problems with leakage through the receiver protector, the far long
*  pulse gates were contaminated at times.  These were not, however, the

*  calibration had finished.  Heater frequencies of 4.04 MHz and 4.544 MHz
*  were used, but only 4.04 MHz produced an observable effect in the radar
*  data.  The heater 'on' periods (1s on, 9s off) are as follows on 9 May
*  (there may also be effects during tuning-up between these times):
*               1235-1249  UT 4.544 MHz
*               1254-1250     4.04
*               1304-1312     4.544
*  The radar operation was relatively trouble-free, producing analyzable data
*  up to ~1400km.
*  Discrepancies occurred between the CPU clock and the real-time clock on
*  a smal number of occasions during the morning of 4 May, by up to about 1s
*  as judged by the eye.  There is a data gap 0622-0656 while the computer was
*  stopped to try to fix this problem.

*  CP-1-K (KINDAT=6122, 6121).  There are gaps of about 20 minutes after 1939
*  8 Jun while the transmitter was off, and after 1627 9 Jun when the Tromso
*  UHF correlator was replaced by the one from the VHF side in an attempt to
*  cure a problem observed in the alternating code data.  The problem,
*  appearing as improperly-formed ACFs, had persisted from the beginning of
*  the experiment.  With the exception of the raw electron density, all

*  CP-4-B (KINDAT=6404).  This experiment started 1600 5 Jul but operational
*  difficulties, related mainly to the transmitter, prevented good data from
*  being collected until 1905.  At 2022 the experiment was stopped and the
*  three default frequencies (F3, F4, F5) were changed to F6, F7, F8 because
*  of the better characteristics in terms of reflected power levels of the
*  latter set.  The frequency code for the two beam directions change from
*  2232 and 2234 to 2238 and 2240, respectively, at this time.  Problems with
*  the transmitter persisted through the first half of the experiment, with
*  several HV trips; as a consequence the high voltage was kept relatively
*  low throughout the run.
*  There is a data gap 1038-1120 6 Jul due to a mains power break, following
*  which, the performance of the transmitter was more stable than earlier.

*  CP-6-B and SP-EI (KINDAT=6604).  The receiver arrangement was similar to
*  that used during earlier operations of the paair of experiments; the CP-6
*  data were received through the VHF receiver system (ALLX) and the SP-EI
*  data were taken into the Y input of the UHF receiver system.  However,
*  contrary to the name of the SP-EI-CP6BV-EW experiment, the beam was NOT
*  phased to the west as earlier, but simply steered to the north by moving
*  the half-antenna in elevation.
*  The experiments were scheduled to be started at 1600 10 Aug, but the
*  start was delayed due to a series of HV trips.  After several hours a
*  burned cable close to the VHF klystron was discovered and replaced.
*  Many HV trips occurred after the restart on 11 Aug. The transmitter was
*  turned off 1942-2035 to allow aluminum shielding to be put around the
*  new cable.  This improved matters but trips occurred every ~5 to ~25
*  minutes, each causing gaps of 2-3 minutes.  Although not ideal, these
*  frequent brief gaps were deemed acceptable considering the main
*  experimental objective was to determine mesospheric winds with time
*  scales of ~tens of minutes or more.
*  A few crowbars occurred among the HV trips, but their frequency was typical
*  until an increase early 13 Aug.  This occasionally caused the ND computer
*  to hang.  It was thus decided to cancel the experiment at 1123.

*  CP-7-F (KINDAT=6712, 6711).  The VHF system was tested during the morning
*  of 6 Sep but proved to crowbar easily at low voltages.  It was therefore
*  raised as slow rate, reaching ~60kV by 1000, the planned start time.  Over
*  the next 3 hrs, several crowbars occurred and the high voltage could not be
*  raised above 70kV.  At 1308 there was another crowbar, following which it
*  was discovered that one of the buffer decks was failing to pulse.  The deck
*  was raised from the oil tank and tested, and eventually a fault was found
*  in the ground level amplifier.  The transmitter was back on by 1900,
*  which became the rescheduled experiment start time.  Operation continued
*  until 2200 7 Sep, but with a considerable number of short breaks due to
*  crowbars, IPA trips, and VAC-ION trips.  There is a gap of about 30 min.
*  after 0100 7 Sep due to various problems, including computer restarts,

*  CP-3-G (KINDAT=6314, 6313).  6 Dec is Finnish independence day, a national
*  holiday.  The experiment was started remotely from Tromso but experienced
*  DMA errors and problems with RT programs.  These were subsequently fixed
*  by the duty staff and the experiment was restarted correctly at 0900.  The
*  heater was tuned to 4.04 MHz at 0910 6 Dec (antenna field 2, vertical beam,
*  O-mode) and pulsing (1s on, 9s off) began at 0912:20.  A narrow region of
*  heater induced backscatter was seen near 230 km for the dumps ending at
*  0913:10-0913:40 when the radar was at elevation angle of 77 degrees,
*  looking South, but not for dumps 0914:10-0916:00 when the antenna was
*  vertical.
*  The same procedure was repeated 8 Dec, with tuning up 1035-1039 and
*  transmission 1042-1045 and again 1112-1116.  In all these cases the
*  critical frequency shown by the dynasonde was below 4 MHz and no heater
*  effects were seen in the radar data.  The CP operation was interrupted
*  1530-1700 6 Dec to allow a UK special programme in support of local
*  optical experiments during auroral activity.

*  CP-3-G and CP-7-F (KINDAT=6314,6313,6712).  The CP-3 program was interrupted
*  on 1 Feb between 1925 and 2100 for a special program for the UK which
*  required clear skies and aurora.  Although it used only VHF, the UHF
*  was also shut down to avoid interference with optical equipment.  After
*  restarting, the high voltage UHF was steadily increased to about 93kV
*  (1.4MW peak power); meanwhile the two VHF klystrons were delivering a
*  combined output between 2.8 and 2.9MW peak power.  Initial analysis
*  revealed the VHF signal strength dropped by a factor of two 1020-1025
*  Feb 2 and remained at that level.  The cause was not known (as of Mar 96),
*  but the data were reanalysed with an adjusted system constant of 0.37.
*  The Tromso UHF antenna azimuth drive developed a fault at 0130 Feb 3,
*  though the experiment continued until 9 UT when a 1 hour interuption was
*  used to fix it.
*  Near midnight 3 Feb a combination of computer an software problems caused
*  several breaks in operation.  One more interuption was when the UHF mode-anode
*  failed.
*  Kiruna and Sodankyla station operations were smooth, though interference
*  at both sites was visible, particularly to the South.

*  CP-1-K and CP-4-B (KINDAT=6122,6121,6404).  All three UHF receivers and
*  both VHF receivers performed well until 1712 Mar 2.  All three klystrons
*  operated nominally for the duration of the experiments but with a number
*  of breaks of several minutes data taking following crowbars (Feb 28: 1447-
*  1452, 2117-2114; 1 Mar: 0945-0956, 1335-1342; 2 Mar:  0014-0018, 0327-0332,
*  0509-0516, 1447-1450, 1456-1458).  At 1712 Mar 2, the radar controller lost
*  synchronization with the real-time clock and could not be forced back to
*  the correct time.  The same thing began at 1724 on the VHF experiment.
*  CP-1 was stopped for good at 1941 and CP-4 at 2220.
*  The geophysical conditions were disturbed most of the time but quieter during

*  CP-6-B (KINDAT=6604).  The experiment scheduled was a split beam CP-6
*  operation with one beam vertical and the second pointing to the north,
*  however, only a single beam was possible over a shorter period than
*  planed.  1 May the UHF receiver side was configured to take the off-vertical
*  VHF signals in the usual way with split-beam operation, but the transmitter
*  would not operate (and repairs were impossible on a holiday) so start
*  was postponed until the next day.  After starting at 0820, no ionospheric
*  signals ere observed by either beam.  As geophysical conditions were quiet,
*  this was put down to absence of precipitation, but when the data analysis
*  produced no results at all, other explanations were sought.  Both CP-4
*  and CP-7 were tested and verified that some signals were passing down
*  the receiver chain.  This was also tested independently using the small
*  VHF transmitter near the antenna - those signals were seen on both the
*  oscilloscope and with the RTGraph (as a DC spike).  The wiring configuration
*  was changed back to normal CP-6 at 1210 with no dramatic affect.  Eventually
*  weak signals were evident in the UHF system (off vertical beam), which
*  coincided with a significant increase in geomagnetic activity.  It is
*  possible there was no D/E-region to return a signal at earlier times,
*  but other causes (e.g., an intermittant fault) cannot be ruled out.  The
*  vertical beam produced no signals so both beams were made parallel to be
*  sure that both were pointing at the same target.  Still there was no
*  signal from the A-side.  The cables were interchanged at the receiver
*  input, resulting in the expected switch and confirming the receivers were
*  operating.  This isolated the problem to the A-side antenna T/R switch which
*  precluded dual beam operation, so at 1313 a normal CP-6 receiver path
*  commenced.  The experiment continued with both klystrons transmitting but
*  for operational reasons klyston A was shut off at 1359, causing the
*  RTGraph to show a peak power of 0 kW.  To adjust for this, the integration
*  and analysis programs were changed to pick up the peak power from position
*  101 in the parameter block.
*  Crowbars resulted in two 1 hour gaps starting 2122 May 3 and 0327 May 4.
*  The peak power value in the parameter block was not set after the restart
*  May 4, so the data were analysed assuming 1.4MW and all the data were
*  reanalysed following a calibration using the UHF radar later that day.
*  CP-1 and CP-7 had been carefully calibrated during the run 28-9 Mar using
*  heater and dynasonde data and the CP-1 power profiles are considered accurate
*  for calibration of the ongoing CP-6 experiment.  CP-1 was run on test
*  purposes at 1050 and comparision to the CP-6 data showed electron densities
*  to be 1.8 times higher.  So the system constant was changed to 0.66 from
*  1.18 and the data reanalysed to give close agreement with the CP-1 profiles.
*  May 5:  The peak power was again not recorded in the paramete block following
*  a crowbar at 0013.  This was fixed at 0236, and the data were analysed
*  assuming a power of 1.4 MW.  Finally an HV trip shut down the transmitter
*  ending the experiment.  (WHEW!)

*  pulse channels, the other being channel 4) was correctly set (it needed
*  to be take from channel 1 on the VHF side).  While testing and correcting

*  CP-6-B (KINDAT=6604).  The scheduled experement included CP-2, but that
*  portion was cancelled because of a high filament current in the UHF
*  system after water leak repairs.  The VHF start was delayed mainly because
*  of a faulty 30MHz reference signal.  A standard oscilloscope was put in
*  place producing the expected signal levels and an apparent power profile
*  from CP-6.  However, no spectra were visible during conditions when they
*  should have been seen.  A test of CP-7 showed good data and it uses channels
*  4, 6 and 8 while CP-6 uses channel 5.  In view of the obvious problem with
*  no remedy, the experiment was cancelled at 10PM local time.  On 24 Oct the
*  problem with the VHF receiver was discovered to be a 50Hz contamination of
*  the L02 on channel 5.  The experiment was started at 0916 taking the L02
*  from channel 6.  The spectra were still poor, so L02 from channel 7 was
*  substituted producing satisfactory improvement.
*  A data gap 24 Oct 2112-2315, due to IPA problems, was followed by a few more
*  brief breaks for adjustments.  A power break about 0800 Oct 25 instigated
*  attempts to revive the UHF system.  The VHF experiment was restarted at
*  1512 though the signals were so weak that no spectra could be seen.  InitiallY
*  quiet geomagnetic conditions were blamed for no specta, but after a crowbar
*  at 1659 the signals were even more strange, so testing commenced, but with
*  no obvious solution, the experiment was cancelled sometime after midnight.
*  Further investigations on the 26th revealed that drive level to the
*  transmitter IPA was too low; this was corrected at 1856 and data were taken
*  through 1600 Oct 27.

*  CP-3-G (KINDAT=6314, 6313 and 6712).  The Tromso long pulse modulation
*  used only 3 (instead of 4) channels because the fourth was attenuated
*  63dB.  The long pulse electron densities were compared during the day time
*  with simultaneous dynasonde data using just the vertical and near vertical
*  positions of the CP-3 scan.  A calibration factor of 1.31 in the analysis
*  agreed well with foF2 values until 1144-1210 Nov 22.  After that time
*  densities were consistently lower than the foF2 values.  Although no
*  malfunction was found the magnitude of the difference suggests one more
*  channel had been lost.  The data from 1200-1600 were reanalyzed using 1.80
*  calibration factor to force agreement with the foF2 values (1.95 was tried
*  too but yielded larger differences).  Note that the UHF klustron was

*  CP-3-G (KINDAT=6314,6313).  This operation began with very many HRP
*  trips and so was run at slightly reduced power for the first 10 hours
*  or so.  An unusual problem resulted in loss of data between 1604 and
*  1755 UT on 22 January.  The whole system seemed to be functioning
*  nominally, with no alarm conditions, but there was actually no RF
*  output.  This was ascribed to an IPA failure and corrected by
*  rebooting the PC controlling the UHF transmitter.
*  The operation ended abruptly before the scheduled time following an
*  HRP at 0810 UT on 24 January.  No signals were received in Troms~
*  following this, although the remote sites continued to see signal.
*  The cause was a leak of coolant water in the hub room.  This would
*  require several hours to fix so the operation was terminated.  A very
*  slight, steady increase in system temperature had been observed over
*  the preceding 24 hours (about 10 K), which was doubtless linked to the
*  ensuing problem.
*  A calibration factor of 1.31 (the same as used for the last CP-3 in
*  November 1995) resulted in very good agreement of long pulse densities
*  with those derived from dynasonde foF2 values.

*  CP-2-E  (KINDAT=6210,6209).  This 78-h run was almost without
*  incident.  The transmitter performed very well, with just a few HRP
*  trips and a couple of crowbars.  The Troms~ system temperature showed
*  four steps up and down, by about 10 K, during the operation, along
*  with a slow increase by about 10 K during the last 8 hours of the
*  experiment.  No obvious cause for these steps could be found.  As all

*  the experiment for investigations during the scheduled operation.
*  The heater was operated at 4.04 MHz between 1250 and 1308 UT on 19

*  Sodankyla had a correlator problem between 0340 and 0700 UT on 21

*  CP-1-K (KINDAT=6122,6121).  There were several short breaks in
*  transmission during the early part of this experiment.  These were
*  caused by a fault with the intermediate power amplifier that inhibited
*  RF transmission without causing an error condition.  The breaks were
*  principally at 10 UT (short), 1110-1138 UT, 1330-1340 UT and 1510-1536
*  UT.  A faulty relay was replaced during the last of these.  Except for
*  a mains power break from 1123-1148 UT on 18 June, the transmitter then
*  stayed on the air throughout.
*  Following a fault with the UPC at 0440 UT on 18 June, the Tromso radar
*  controller was set to a pre-integration time of 10 seconds instead of
*  the normal 5 seconds.  This was corrected at 0720 UT.  During the
*  intervening 2.5 hours the remote site snr was thus reduced by 50%.
*  A comparison of the EISCAT peak F-region electron densities on this
*  tape (analysed with a calibration factor of 1.38) with those
*  determined from foF2 values from the dynasonde showed that the EISCAT
*  densities from this analysis are about 15% too high.

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6210,6209).  This experiment ran from 10 UT on 16 July
*  to 16 UT on 17 July, with many problems due to crowbars.  The breaks
*  were mostly just a few minutes, but more significant ones occurred at
*  1507-1710 UT and 1730-1837 UT on 16 July.
*  Good tristatic data were recorded until 1507 UT on 16 July, when the
*  transmitter went down.  The experiment was subsequently restarted in
*  Tromso at 1710 UT.  As all 3 sites are synchronised to a 6-min cycle
*  with a whole hour as origin, this new start time threw Tromso out of
*  step with the remotes.
*  After further difficulties in Tromso, the experiment there was started
*  again at 1837 UT.  Thus the Tromso scan was 1 minute behind the remote
*  sites, which had started their most recent scan at 1836 UT.  This
*  condition prevailed until the end of the experiment.
*  A 1-min delay in Tromso means that some of the signal is lost at the
*  remote sites, for the following reason.  Each position in CP-2 is
*  nominally 90 seconds.  But the antenna motions take up 27, 25, 40 and
*  10 sec respectively for the 4 positions.  Subtracting the 1-min delay
*  leaves true common volume times of 3, 5, 0 and 20 seconds,
*  respectively, in this case. (These values are slightly different for
*  the two remote sites.)
*  Thus, at the remote sites, one position observed no signal, two had
*  little signal, and the fourth had lower snr than usual.  The Tromso

*  Although resolved velocity records are included, the velocities are

*  Thus tri-static velocities could not be computed.  However, as this
*  was CP-2 (4-position, 6-minute scans), some information may be

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6210,6209).  The refurbished UHF klystron SN103 had
*  been under test for the preceding several weeks but refused to put out
*  sufficient power levels for experiments.  Thus the original SN101 was
*  put back in socket on 7 October.  However, the performance of this
*  klystron also left something to be desired, as it tripped if the HV
*  was raised above 83 kV.  This corresponds to a peak power of close to1
*  MW.  This was thus the nominal value throughout, but even so there
*  were quite a number of trips.
*  The system temperature continued to show steps up and down by about 10
*  K.  There was also a period of several hours towards the end of
*  October 11 when the system temperature went up to about 130 K, the
*  cause of which is unknown.
*  The common volume height was reduced to 240 km (from 278 km) at 1224
*  UT on October 11 in an attempt to maximise the snr at the remotes.
*  This height was kept until the end of the experiment.
*  A deep depression with storm force winds crossed northern Scandinavia
*  on October 12, damaging, among other things, the Tromso wind speed

*  The common volume height was reduced to 220 km at 1336 UT on 6

*  significant breaks occurred:
*     6 Jan 1756 UT new countdown after UPC hanging.
*     6 Jan 1836 UT new countdown after UPC hanging.
*     6 Jan 2308 UT new countdown after UPC hanging.
*     7 Jan 0150 UT crowbar.
*     8 Jan         A few brief breaks due to crowbars and HRPs.
*     9 Jan 1207-1406 UT: The antenna was lowered to empty it of snow. At
*                         the same time, it was noticed that the antenna
*                         rails were seriously compacted with snow, resulting
*                         in a longer break to clean them.  (Heavy snow and
*                         strong winds all week.)
*    10 Jan         The real-time analyses showed hard precipitation in the
*                   late morning and large convection velocities around midday
*                   and into the afternoon.  Vector velocities were missing
*                   between 22 UT (9 Jan) and 0830 UT (10 Jan) due to a
*                   computer problem in Sodankyla that stopped the experiment.
*  These geophysical events were the signature of the coronal mass
*  ejection, that occurred on January 6, reaching the Earth.
*  Sodankyla also suffered a similar loss of data between 0906 UT

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6110,6109).
*  This version of CP-2 used the new selection of frequencies (all
*  +1 MHz) as first employed in the CP-1 in February.  The
*  experiment was started at 1048 UT but there were several
*  EROS-related problems and the data were not being recorded to the
*  sparc.  Everything was stopped at 12 UT and EROS was exited.  The
*  command RT EROSCL was then given before restarting EROS.  The
*  experiment was restarted at 1224 UT.  The operation suffered from
*  most of the same breaks as the VHF mentioned below, specifically
*  1725-1740 UT on March 11, then on March 12 at 0405-0416 UT,
*  0435-0450 UT and 1300-1330 UT.  Raw data were not recorded
*  between 0651 UT (after the ND reboot) and 0817 UT when this was
*  noticed.  No data were dumped to the sparc between 0312 and 0818
*  UT.  Integrated data are available for this period.  At 1035 UT a
*  sudden UHF receiver error appeared, which was tracked down to a
*  faulty power supply.  It is probable that some of the earlier
*  problems were related to this fault.  The system was available
*  again at 1147 UT.
**
*  Sodankyla had many difficulties and data gaps (including most of
*  the night hours) due to an adc problem that recurred every couple
*  of hours.  Kiruna had no problems.
**
*  The common volume height was set to 220 km.  This has been put in
*  the CP-2 experiment files, along with the new field-aligned
*  pointing direction (azimuth 183.0 , elevation 77.1 , for 250 km
*  altitude) and the new frequency settings.
**
*  The Tromso CP-2 data were analysed with Guisdap in real time, as
*  well as on the ND (CP-4 on the ND too).  The CP-2 densities came
*  out about 25% too high in an initial analysis using the same
*  system constant that gave good agreement with the dynasonde in
*  February (1.85).  The data were reanalysed using a value of 1.44,
*  producing good agreement.

*  CP-4-B (VHS, KINST=74, KINDAT=6404).
*  CP-4 was tested early on 11 March; no problems were found so it
*  was started (early) at 0905:01 UT.  The transmitter tripped at
*  0927 UT and needed considerable work to get it functioning again.
*  The experiment was restarted at 1215:01 UT.  At 1725 UT the
*  transmitter tripped to power-off (maybe due to a brief power
*  break?), enforcing a new countdown and restart at 1750 UT.  There
*  were a couple of breaks between 04-05 UT on 12 March related to
*  UHF receiver problems.  The final restart was at 0450 UT.  At
*  0537 UT another trip necessitated a new countdown.  At 0646 UT
*  the ND computer was rebooted due to problems with data recording;
*  restart at 0651 UT.  More data recording problems occurred at
*  about 13 UT, followed by a reboot of the ND computer and
*  successful restart of the experiment at 1330:01 UT.  There were
*  also a few brief HV trips at other times during the experiment.

*  CP-3-F (KINDAT=6312,6311).
*  CP-3 was initially scheduled to run from 10 UT on 8 April to 16
*  UT on 10 April.  The experiment was tested early on 8 April and
*  performed correctly.  The run proper was started at 0930 UT, but
*  was immediately beset by problems on the receiver side (at least
*  a loose connector, but maybe also a short-circuit causing current
*  surges in the receiver rack) and with the transmitter (crowbars
*  at low HV).  The receiver problem was fixed and the experiment
*  restarted at 1230 UT.  The transmitter continued to cause
*  problems and a fault was traced to the HV switch-gear, which was
*  brought into the lab.  The alignment of a solenoid was adjusted
*  to clear the problem.  No data were saved in this initial period
*  (0930-1500 UT).
**
*  A new restart occurred at 1500 UT though the HV was low (70 kV).
*  At about 1530 UT it was noticed that the data were not, and had
*  not been for some time, dumped to the ND.  This could not be
*  rectified by EROS commands so the experiment was stopped and
*  restarted at 1545 UT (with a requested start time of 1530 UT).
*  This action caused a loop (cycle) time to be added to the
*  requested start time, so the new start became 1600 UT.  The
*  transfer to the sparc failed after a few minutes, for no apparent
*  reason.  The experiment continued, but it proved impossible to
*  raise the HV above 75 kV without a crowbar; the operating value
*  was often less than this (range 70-75 kV).
**
*  An attempt was made to get the sparc transfer going again
*  sometime after 20 UT.  This was unsuccessful, and NEW-FILE
*  commands had no effect on the data recording to the ND.  The
*  expected 30-min file mark at 2030 UT was not written either, so
*  it looked as if we would end up with huge data files as seen
*  earlier (e.g.  CP-1, 6-7 Nov 1996).  The experiment was stopped
*  and an UNLOAD command issued, but the command stack was by then
*  corrupt and there was no logical response from EROS.  It was of
*  course impossible to exit EROS without the UNLOAD command being
*  executed, so the ND was rebooted - twice.  The experiment was
*  restarted at 2108 UT (this time the start time of 2100 UT caused
*  a skipping-on action rather than a loop-time added one).  The
*  sparc transfer started successfully with the experiment.
**
*  CP-3 continued through the night of 8-9 April, but still with the
*  HV no higher than 75 kV.  The signals from a good number of the
*  lower gates were quite reasonable even with such low power (500
*  kW), but distant gates and the remotes were poor (though Kiruna
*  not too bad under the circumstances).  At 0730 UT the experiment
*  was stopped for tests on the transmitter.  Using CP-1 as part of
*  these, a HV of 88 kV could be reached.
**
*  CP-3 was restarted at 0808 UT and continued until 0924 UT (the
*  sparc transfer stopped at 0853 UT for no obvious reason).  The
*  transmitter was frequently up and down in this period.  The
*  termination at 0924 UT was to allow a further test using CP-1 to
*  see whether a higher HV really could be maintained for a
*  reasonable time (ruling out e.g. a water leak in the klystron as
*  a cause of the CP-3 crowbars).  This test was successful with 90
*  kV operation, so CP-3 was restarted at 1030 UT.  It was, however,
*  still not possible to raise the klystron above 75 kV so the
*  experiment was terminated at 1354 UT. (The sparc transfer started
*  with the experiment at 1030 UT but stopped at 1048 UT.)

*  CP-1-K (KINDAT=6122,6121).
*  A start of CP-1-K was quickly scheduled for 1400 UT in Tromso and
*  Kiruna (the sparc transfer did not start in Tromso).  The staff in
*  Sodankyla had by then gone home (filters need changing between
*  CP-3 and CP-1 at remotes).  A remote UNLOAD and MOUNT from Tromso
*  to Sodankyla showed no free disk set available.  There had been
*  some free earlier, and it turned out that the data on the disk
*  sets flagged as unloaded had actually already been copied.  This
*  fault was probably related to the replacement of the ND disk
*  units some days previously.  Sodankyla was started correctly at
*  1500 UT.
**
*  The CP-1 experiment files at all 3 sites had a common volume of
*  300 km.  This was changed to 250 km (with azimuth 183.0 ,
*  elevation 77.1 ) at 1530 UT and the experiment files updated with
*  these values.  The experiment continued without further problems
*  (at ~93 kV) except for a brief break of about 10 minutes
*  following a crowbar at 1720 UT.
**
*  This was part of a telescience operation aimed at studying the
*  effects of a coronal mass ejection expected at Earth at about
*  midnight UT on 9 April.  The original scheduled stop (16 UT, 10
*  April) was extended to 22 UT to take account of these conditions.
*  Horizontal ion velocities in excess of 1 km/sec were seen towards
*  the end of the experiment.
**
*  The vector velocities from the earlier CP-3 look pretty useless
*  due to the low transmitted power, but those from CP-1 appear
*  excellent (good snr and more-or-less complete time series).

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6210,6209).
*  A CP-2-E operation was scheduled from 10 UT on 21 October to 20
*  UT on 23 October (58 hours).  This was a World Day interval and
*  part of a longer UARC campaign period.
**
*  The experiment was tested actively for a good hour on the morning
*  of 21 October with no apparent problems, except that the
*  alternating code signals at the remote sites were being received
*  slightly early.  These should be centred in gate 4 (of 7) but
*  were in typically gate 3 in Kiruna and gate 2 in Sodankyla.  The
*  signals were re-centred by adjusting the offset ppd from -422 to
*  -432 5s in Kiruna and from -415 to -450 5s in Sodankyla.
**
*  The experiment started on schedule at all sites.  After a while
*  it was realised that the data transfer to the sparc in Tromso was
*  not running (the recording on the ND was OK).  After various
*  investigations the transfer was eventually restarted with the
*  usual EROS commands 'SP-TR Y' followed by 'NEW-FILE'.  Data recording
*  started at 1046 UT.
**
*  The 405s power profile data, measured on channels 1 and 2, showed
*  some deviant behaviour.  In the south antenna position, and
*  sometimes in the south-east position, the data showed excess
*  noise in the first few gates, though not in every scan.  This
*  feature fell off from a maximum in the first gate to
*  approximately normal values by about gate 12.  That it
*  constituted a hardware problem, and not e.g. clutter (and
*  certainly not an ionospheric signal) was confirmed by its absence
*  in the 21 5s power profile data.  Channels 1 and 2 were
*  alternately attenuated out between 1046 and 1108 UT on 22 October
*  to investigate this problem.  Channel 2 turned out to be much the
*  worse, even showing an effect in the B// and vertical positions.
*  But even with channel 2 attenuated out (63 dB), channel 1
*  continued to display similar characteristics to the combined
*  data.  The experiment continued from 1108 UT with only channel 1
*  for this power profile.  Investigations after the experiment
*  showed the problem to be a power splitter in the receiver rack,
*  affecting both channels 1 and 2, but channel 2 being the worse.
*  The faulty component was replaced.
**
*  The ND analysis ran smoothly.  A comparison of long pulse
*  electron densities with dynasonde (and digisonde) critical
*  frequencies showed the EISCAT densities to be about 15% too low
*  (using a system constant of 1.44 - this was last set in March
*  with a dynasonde calibration).  The calibration factor was
*  changed to 1.656 for the final analysis. [Note - klystron SN103R
*  has been in socket since 30 September.]
**
*  The Kiruna site experienced some software problems during the
*  first night.  Raw data was not recorded between 2136 UT on 21
*  October and 0016 UT on 22 October.  The experiment was stopped at
*  0016 UT and restarted at 0030 UT.  The integration program on the
*  ND ran throughout, so the only gap in analysed data is from 0016
*  to 0030 UT.
**
*  No problems reported from Sodankyla.

*  the last evening, just before we closed down.

*  CP-6-B (VHS, KINST=74, KINDAT=6604).
*  A CP-6-B operation was planned from 10 UT on 4 November to 16 UT
*  on 5 November.  Good signals (down to 75 km) were observed during
*  tests on the morning of 4 November so the experiment was started
*  early, at 0908 UT.  The increased D-region densities turned out
*  to be related to a moderately weak PCA event and the ionisation
*  fell off quite rapidly, having disappeared altogether by about 12
*  UT. (The proton fluxes at geostationary orbit remained enhanced
*  for the whole experiment, but evidently at levels not large
*  enough to give measurable increases in electron density).
**
*  With CP-6 under way, an attempt was made to start SP-EI-CP6BV-NS
*  (i.e.  CP-6 pointing at elevation 75.2 to the north, on the E
*  half of the antenna).  The data appeared poor, with many spikes
*  and other noise making the ionospheric signal hard to see.
*  Despite prolonged investigations during the day, the source of
*  the problem could not be located and the UHF side was stopped at
*  1440 UT.  The configuration was then changed from separate, to
*  combined, beams and CP-6 started using the full antenna. (The UHF
*  side would anyway be needed after a few hours for an SP-NO
*  experiment in support of a rocket countdown.) The tests were
*  complicated by many crowbars during this period, a phenomenon
*  that came and went irregularly with no apparent reason.
**
*  The peak power was recorded and displayed correctly (e.g. by
*  RTGraph) at the beginning of the experiment but became zero after
*  a crowbar around 1030 UT.  The peak power for the B-side
*  (position 101 in the parameter block) continued to be recorded so
*  this was used in the data analysis.
**
*  At 0343 UT on 5 November a crowbar was followed by a problem with
*  the cooling water supply.  This took a while to fix and the
*  experiment was eventually back on the air at 0658 UT.  The
*  transmitter was turned off at 0758 UT for a final check on the
*  water problem, with a restart at 0840 UT.
**
*  No raw data could be copied to the 6250 bpi tapes because of a
*  hardware fault with the ND tape drive.  At 1059 UT on 5 November
*  the last free disk set was filled and all data recording stopped
*  (even to the sparc).  A disk set was re-initialised (all earlier
*  raw data had been recorded on the sparc) and recording restarted
*  at 1122 UT.  The tape drive was repaired by a serviceman in the
*  afternoon.

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6210,6209).
*  CP-7 (2-klystron) had been scheduled for this World Day interval
*  but a burned cable at the antenna (B-side) was discovered on 1
*  December, probably requiring several weeks to repair.  CP-2 was
*  scheduled in its place, to start at 16 UT, or earlier if
*  possible, on 2 December.  The experiment was started at 15 UT,
*  though the staff in Sodankyla, who had already left, had not been
*  aware of the change in the schedule and the wrong post-detection
*  filters were in place.  The on-duty person was post-detected some
*  200 km from the site, but after a string of unanswered calls and
*  answering machines speaking Finnish a local willing soul was
*  found and the correct filters put in by 1545 UT.
**
*  Shortly after the start, the post-integrated long pulse
*  background and calibration spectra in Sodankyla were seen to be
*  asymmetric, with more power on the high frequency (right) side.
*  Inspection of individual 5-sec dumps showed this to be due to
*  typically 1 to 3 individual peaks changing more-or-less randomly
*  in time, frequency and amplitude.  This behaviour may have been
*  correlated with the antenna scanning, though the randomness of
*  the variations made this hard to determine.  Alternately
*  attenuating out the two long pulse channels (3 and 4, on F9 and
*  F10 respectively) showed F10 to be the main culprit.  This
*  feature disappeared after a while, but re-appeared the next day
*  (3 Dec) at about 1240 UT.  This time, however, there were no
*  individual peaks in the spectra, just a linear increase of power
*  from the left side to the right side, even at 5-sec resolution.
*  Tests with a frequency analyser in Sodankyla showed that there was
*  wide-band noise (several MHz) above some point between F10 and
*  F11.  This interference was strong and caused overflows in the
*  ADC.  After various tests lasting about an hour, the experiment
*  continued with only F9 being received.  The ionospheric signal
*  was weak or non-existent for most of the experiment at Sodankyla
*  and the data should only be used after careful checks.
*  Subsequent investigations identified the interfering source as a
*  nearby military radio link.
**
*  In Tromso there was a short gap between 1005 and 1013 UT on 3
*  December following a crowbar.  At 1747 UT another crowbar caused
*  the UPC to begin a new countdown.  On restart at 1808 UT, a few
*  minutes of data were taken before another crowbar at 1812 UT,
*  after which it was impossible to obtain pulsing from the UPC.  A
*  restart was possible at 1954 UT.  A further crowbar at 0205 UT (4
*  Dec) necessitated a new countdown, with restart at 0226 UT and
*  experiment end at 0800 UT.  The transmitter high voltage was
*  deliberately kept low because of HRPs above about 89 kV.  Because
*  of this, together with the low solar zenith angle and only weakly
*  disturbed conditions, the signals in Tromso and Kiruna were also
*  at times poor.  A system constant of 1.656 gave good agreement
*  with dynasonde foF2 critical frequencies (same value as in
*  October).

*  CP-7-G (KINDAT=6714).
*  The scheduled start (10 UT) was delayed, initially by tests on
*  the phase matching of the two halves of the VHF transmission
*  lines, then by TX problems that turned out to be due to a loose
*  cable at the UHF end of the cap-bank, causing arcing.  The
*  experiment was eventually started at 1330 UT (26 May).
**
*  CP-7-G-V is experiment SP-EI-CP72-V (or SP-EI-VHF2MS-V using 35.4
*  kHz filters).  Recent work on the VHF receiver meant that the
*  configuration needed to be ALLX.  Also, the attenuator settings
*  needed revising.  The signal path for X was set to 0 dB
*  (previously 12 dB when it was ALLY) and the channels were
*  adjusted by inspection of the oscilloscope signals.  Channel 4
*  (actually using channel 3) needed 11 dB, channel 6 needed 5 dB
*  and channel 8 needed 3 dB.  Channel 8 seemed noisier than the
*  others so it was connected to channel 1 instead, but there was
*  little obvious improvement.  Attenuator settings in the earlier
*  version for channels 4, 6 and 8 were 14, 20 and 20 dB,
*  respectively.
**
*  There were several gaps due to TX-related problems:
*     1709-1724 UT (26 May) due to a temperature sensor fault.
*     1732 to about 1830 UT (26 May) - several major breaks due to crowbars.
*     2220-2307 UT (26 May) - crowbar caused ND problems.
*     0251-0304 UT (27 May) - HV trip followed by a crowbar.
*     1010-1048 UT (27 May) - crowbar caused ND problems (no sparc transfer on
*                             restart) so exited EROS, did RT EROSCL and restarted.
*     2328-0210 UT (28 May) - similar sequence of events - crowbar, ND hanging, no
*                             sparc transfer happened about 3 times.
*  Major gap 0130 - 0210 UT. 0210 UT, restarted experiment but fire
*  alarm sounded while attempting to raise HV (which was producing
*  crowbars at the time).  The transmitter hall was full of smoke so
*  everything was switched off.  The fault was a burned piece of
*  rubber at the VHF end of the cap-bank.  The area was cleaned up
*  and the switching arm re-adjusted for smoother operation.
**
*  The experiment was restarted at 0812 UT (28 May) with RF on at
*  0820 UT and uneventful continuation until the scheduled stop at
*  16 UT.

*  CP-4-B (KINDAT 6404)
*  The start was at 10 UT, using a paralleled cap-bank.  The cable
*  connections for channels 3 and 4 were initially wrong, rectified
*  at 1035 UT.
**
*  Long pulse densities from the two beams were rather similar but
*  the B-side/phased/Y beam power profile results were significantly
*  smaller than the latter and the A-side/unphased/X power profile
*  results sometimes larger than the acf densities.  Otherwise, no
*  problems.

*  CP-1-K (KINDAT=6121, 6122)
*  The Sodankyla alternating code signal was initially in gate 2 so
*  the offset ppd was shifted from -415 ms to -455ms to centre it in
*  gate 4.
**
*  Between 0930 and 0959 UT the antennas were directed towards
*  Andenes (POINT-GEOG 68.44, 10.0, 250.0) for tests in conjunction
*  with the MF radar there.  The antenna was again field-aligned by
*  10 UT, where it stayed until the end of the experiment.
**
*  Calibration of peak F-region densities from the long pulse with
*  local digisonde foF2 values suggested a value of 1.24 for the
*  system constant, which was therefore applied in the data
*  analysis.
**
*  A power failure in Kiruna caused loss of vector velocities and of
*  recorded raw data between 0320 and 0524 UT on 19 August.
*  However, the ND integration program continued to run and analysed
*  data are available on the tape.

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6209, 6210)
*  As the VHF antenna was still phased, CP-6 was a 1-klystron
*  operation using the A-side ('X').
**
*  The Sodankyla alternating code signal was shifted towards gate 3
*  so the offset ppd was changed from -450 ms to -460 ms to centre
*  it in gate 4.
**
*  The F-region peak was clearly higher than the common volume at
*  220 km so this was changed to 278 km at 1824 UT (21 Sept) where
*  it stayed until the end of the experiment (:ELAN files changed
*  also).
**
*  The system temperature in the south position of CP-2 was
*  systematically higher than the other 3 positions (which were all
*  very similar).  It changed slowly and irregularly with time,
*  being typically 10-40K higher, generally lowest at night.  The
*  background spectra there showed a DC peak, about 30% higher than
*  the normal spectrum.  However, the SE and FA position showed a
*  similar, but smaller peak, with nothing at vertical.  The cause
*  of this increase in Tsys is unknown at the time of writing.
**
*  From about 1300 to 1411 UT (23 Sept) eiscatt was down following a
*  power cycle on one of the tape drives and subsequent difficulties
*  in rebooting.  Raw data were not dumped to the sparc for this
*  period but the 1/2" copies of the relevant data sets were made on
*  the ND.
**
*  Several crowbars occurred, mainly during the first 3 days and
*  mostly on 23 Sept.  Sept 24 and 25 were very stable,
*  transmitter-wise.
**
*  Geophysical conditions were relatively disturbed.  In particular,
*  on the final day (25 Sept) large electric fields were observed
*  and the experiment was extended beyond the scheduled stop time,
*  eventually terminating at 18 UT.

*  CP-6-B (KINDAT=6604)
*  On VHF, the peak power reading (on RTG and from integration
*  program) was zero.  This was corrected at 1248 UT (21 Sept) by
*  switching the 'A' and 'B' peak power input cables to the camac
*  adc.
**
*  On the VHF side, the ND started producing data files without
*  30-min e-o-f marks after a crowbar at 1926 UT (22 Sept).  This
*  could have been noticed by checking the V-EROS console, or by
*  noting that the 'RESTART' displayed by PR-EXP was not correct
*  (should be the start of the next do-loop).  The problem was
*  because AUXRUN had stopped and was remedied by issuing the RT
*  AUXRUN command.  This was rectified at 0633 UT (23 Sept).

*  CP-7-G (KINDAT=6714)
*  Both klystrons were used with a paralleled capacitor bank during
*  this operation, with the VHF receiver path set to ALLX.  No
*  problems were reported until about local midnight on November 24
*  when the transmitter hall began to fill with smoke following a
*  crowbar.  The fault, burnt rubber at the VHF end of the cap-bank,
*  was the same as occurred during the previous run of CP-7-G in
*  May.  With less than one hour of scheduled operation remaining
*  the experiment was terminated.

*  CP-4-B (KINDAT=6404)
*  The only technical problem during this operation was a faulty LO2
*  in channel 4.  At 2024 UT on 8 December it was noticed that there
*  was no signal in this channel.  There is no direct information to
*  indicate how long this had persisted.  At 2040 UT the LO2 from
*  channel 1 was connected to channel 4 (note that this has an 8 MHz
*  bandpass filter compared with 1.2 MHz in channels 3-8).  The
*  faulty LO2 was repaired and connected back in at 2145 UT.

*  CP-4-B (KINDAT=6404)
*  The received signals showed intermittent, irregular behaviour
*  during this run, with the most serious effects in the unphased
*  beam (B-side, Y channel).  The problem appeared as unstable gain
*  as a function of receiver open time.  When the background gates
*  were subtracted the signal at the shorter ranges was sometimes
*  too large, or sometimes too small.  Further investigation of this
*  effect was prevented when the ND computer suffered a disk crash
*  (pack-three) at 0230 UT on 13 January, causing the experiment to
*  be terminated.

*  CP-1-K (KINDAT=6121, 6122)
*  Tromso ran fairly smoothly during this experiment, with just a few crowbars
*  causing gaps of a few minutes, notably at:
*     2328 UT, 9 Feb
*     2008 UT, 10 Feb
*     1143 UT, 11 Feb
*     2000 UT, 11 Feb
*     0616 UT, 12 Feb
*     1513 UT, 12 Feb
**
*  The remote sites suffered some problems that affected the data.
**
*  At Kiruna, the LO1 lost the lock to its reference at about 0014
*  UT on 11 February and continued in this state until 0750 UT.  The
*  effect of this was to introduce a Doppler shift to the signal
*  which looked like about 1 km/sec in terms of ion velocity.
*  Although the offset was relatively constant, it is not possible
*  to say whether it was exactly constant (in which case simple
*  subtraction could be used to obtain the ionospheric velocities).
*  Rather, the evidence suggests that the frequency may have had
*  some inherent variability in this state and the data should only
*  be used with great care.  The same problem recurred between about
*  2000-2035 UT, again between 2200-2230 UT on 11 February, and also
*  between 0400-0746 UT on 12 February.
**
*  Strong interference signals were observed in the measured spectra
*  at Kiruna during the last hour of the experiment.  These were
*  apparently not stationary as some residual effect could be seen
*  in the signal-minus-background spectra and the results are not
*  very reliable.
**
*  The Sodankyla correlator reported an error condition quite often
*  throughout this experiment.  A recover-correlator command was
*  usually sufficient to rectify this, although there were sometimes
*  longer periods when it went unnoticed (night time).  The effect
*  seemed to be the same each time, producing two points with
*  erroneous large values in the alternating code part of the data
*  dump.  The alternating code signal and all of the long pulse part
*  of the dump seemed to be unaffected and can probably be used with
*  confidence.
*  NOTE:  Vpe error (-1240) and Vpn error (-1250) have unreasonable (negative)
*  values: 15-20 UT Feb 9, 17-19 UT Feb 10, 1-7 UT 12 Feb.

*  CP-2-E (KINDAT=6209, 6210)
*  The Heating facility was operated for a short time just after the
*  start of this experiment, between 1130 and 1138 UT (8 March),
*  running simultaneously a program of 1-sec on followed by 9-sec
*  off at both 4.04 MHz and 5.423 MHz.
**
*  The Kiruna antenna developed an elevation motor fault on the
*  evening of 8 March and the data-taking was stopped there at 1730
*  UT.  At 0740 UT the next morning the antenna was steered into the
*  Tromso field-aligned position so that at least some data could be
*  collected while the motor was being repaired.  Scanning was
*  resumed at 1450 UT on 10 March, although there are a couple of
*  short gaps in the subsequent two hours when adjustments were
*  made.
**
*  On 12 March a crowbar at 1201 UT was followed by problems with
*  the high-voltage switch-gear.  As this would require several
*  hours to fix, the experiment, with less than four more scheduled
*  hours to run, was cancelled at that point.

**
*  LATE 1990s EQUIPMENT CHANGES:
*  During the mid-1990s numerous flaws caused by corrosion were repaired in
*  the antenna array.  Faraday rotation experiments restarted October 1996
*  after also subtracting experimental biases introduced by polarization
*  crosstalk, imperfect quadrature detection, and other subtle effects.
*  In late 1997 the computer was replaced allowing increasing the number of
*  lags and using a full-time duty cycle.  A dual-pulse scheme commenced
*  November 2000 which reduces clutter.
**
*  KINDAT=1800:
*  Single pulse Faraday rotation experiments from October 1996 to October 1999
*  measure Ne, Te, Ti (not drifts).  An estimate of the absolute electron
*  density is derived from the measured polarization of the scattered signal.
*  This estimate is used to normalize the total scattered power so as to yield
*  a robust estimate of the electron density at altitudes between approximately
*  100-1000 km.  The autocorrelation function of the scattered signal is also
*  measured.  Ne is now reported "uncorrected"; akin to return power, this
*  magnifies the corrupting coherent echos induced by the electrojet at low
*  heights or spread-F in the F-region, thus making it easier to spot the
*  affected altitudes.  A correction formula is provided in the header.
**
*  KINDAT=1801:
*  This dual pulse scheme was upgraded by adding randomized alternating codes
*  starting November 2000.  Strong clutter can enter through sidelobes in the
*  antenna pattern introduced by plasma irregularities in the equatorial
*  electrojet but clutter is reduced when using a double-pulse pattern and
*  the ACF is assembled one lag at a time.  However, the accumulation of lag
*  product estimates takes place relatively slowly and the statistical
*  uncertainty of the ACF measurements is somewhat high for the integration
*  times applied here.  It is therefore often impractical to fit the ACFs for
*  more than two parameters simultaneously.  Between 0600-2000 LT, Te and Tr are
*  the fit parameters.  Outside of this daytime window, the Te and Ti are
*  assumed to be equal and the parameters fit are T=Te=Ti and H+ concentration.
**
*  KINDAT=1802:
*  Starting in April 2004, an uncoded long pulse was added to the dual pulse
*  scheme with alternating codes (KINDAT=1801).  Long pulse returns are
*  fitted for temperature and composition at high altitudes starting at 450km.
**
*  KINDAT=1910:
*  Ion drifts for all altitudes (<100km to ~1000km).  These data can include
*  low altitudes with insignificant electron number density.  Below 200 km,
*  the returns are a combination of different coherent echoes:
*    1) Below 60 km, mountains, atmospheric echoes and the transmitter self
*       (ground) clutter.
*    2) Around 100 km, meteors, electrojet irregularities
*    3) Around 150 km, the so-called 150 km echoes.
*  In summary, incoherent scatter information is only valid above 200 km.
**
*  Note also, starting June 2004 the sampling range changes from 15km to 12km.
**
*  KINDAT=1911:
*  Ht. averaged ion drifts for the F-region with spread-F removed.

*  These are meridional neutral winds data.  They were prepared by SRI for Ray
*  Roble and Barb Emery (Jun 87); SRI refers to this as a WINDPORT tape.  No
*  header record was provided but a number of noteworthy remarks were in the
*  cover letter accompanying the tape:
*   (1) Vector velocities were derived from line of sight observations, also
*       calculated were average density and temperature profiles.
*   (2) Transmitter chirp correction to the Vlos data were made in consultation
*       with Millstone Hill personnel.
*   (3) The uncertainties for Vlos data were carried throughout the calculation
*   (4) No uncertainties were used for the densities, temperatures and their
*       derivatives.
*   (5) MSIS 83 neutral densities were also used to calculate neutral winds.
*   (6) In calculating the winds, the Schunk and Walker (1973) O+O-collision
*       frequency was multiplied by 1.7.
*   (7) About using the data (by Vince Wickwar):  Data he has presented were
*       smoothed by 1-hr running averages.  Sometimes there was also averaging
*       over a limited altitude region.  Although the meridional wind was
*       calculated to high altitudes, values are dubious above about 350 km.
*       In general the data are valid between the lowest altitude with good
*       signal to noise ratio and about 400 km.  Above 400 km the radar data
*       may be contaminated by hydrogen, the SNR is low, and the correction
*       for ion-neutral collision frequencies is enormous.  When using the
*       meridional winds, values are dropped when uncertainties exceed
*       100 m/s at Millstone Hill.

*SON General Notes
*  May 1990:  Carol Leger's letter categorizes the many record types:
*    (1) Basic parameters:
*      (A) Elevation scan data - program ACPORT or ACPORTS
*          ---- KINDAT ----
*          5150, 5151, 5152        Density profiles
*          5171                    Temperatures from OAC spectral channel
*          5174                    Spline coeficients (ignore this)
*      (B) Fixed position data - program ACPORT or ACPORTF
*         (Fixed position is a generic term for anything that is not a scan
*          of some type.)
*          5100, 5101, 5102        Density profiles
*          5121                    Temperatures from OAC spectral channel
*          5124                    Spline coefficients (ignore this)
*    (2) Derived parameters:
*      (A) 11-position type data - program PECPORT
*          15021                   Resolved velocities
*      (B) 3-position data - program VPORT
*          (The records for basic params in item 1B may be repeated in VPORT.)
*          5103                    Density profiles
*          15013                   Resolved velocities from OAC
*          15014                   Resolved velocities from MAC
*      (C) 3-position data - program PECPORT
*          ([They] usually process 3-position data as in 2B, but it is possible
*          to use PECPORT instead.  If [we] get any of these data, please
*          inform Odile de la Beaujardiere.)
*  A more extensive record type summary is in file ~bozo/is/docs/inst.notes/son
**
*  CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
*  Starting with 1994 data, experiments are usually provided with 1-sigma
*  (68% confidence interval) error bars.  Prior submissions were 3-sigma
*  (99% confidence interval); the tradeoff is noise for time or height resolution.
**
*  LONG PULSE AND ALTERNATING CODE (SHORT PULSE) (Aug 1994, Jan 2004):
*  Long radar pulses (10s of km) are used for optimum return signal from the
*  F-region but they smear over significant vertical changes in the E-region,
*  so short pulses and phase encoding (alternating code) are also used.  Analyses
*  differ to account for composition and collision frequency so separate files
*  are produced; for short pulse analyses, reference is made to SRI's designation
*  '-a16' or '-dt1'.  Long pulse analyses are usually available although not
*  always identified as such.  Short pulse is less common and always identified
*  here; they are increasingly common depending on season and solar cycle.  When
*  both are available the same KINDAT is used for certain record types (e.g.
*  ACPORT power profiles with KINDAT=9001 and PECPORT resolved ion velocities with
*  KINDAT=15011); such ambiguities may always be resolved by inspecting the pulse
*  length (parameter code 402).
**
*  ALTERNATING CODE ANALYSES FOR JAN 1990 - JUL 1991 (Feb 2002):
*  It has been reported that E-region heights can be off for alternating code
*  (A16) analyses.  SRI's reply is:  It effects only the short pulse (M4, M5
*  and A16) data from January 1990 thru July 2001.  The A16 data after July
*  2001 have this 3km correction.  We are upgrading our fitter program to
*  improve the way it handles the alternating code data, which should give a
*  noticable improvement to the fitted A16 data.  When that is ready, we will
*  reprocess all the shortpulse data and submit them to the CDB.  In the
*  meantime, the existing files are okay to use, just not as accurate as the
*  new ones will be.
**
*  COMPOSITE SCANS AND VEL2CMPBIN  VR AND E VS. LATITUDE (Sep 2002):
*  The following description applies to the Wide Latitude Study (WLS) campaigns
*  and the velbinport output; see also the "Derivation of Conductivity" in the
*  ISR data description at http://isr.sri.com
**
*  A composite scan involves moving the antenna simultaneously in azimuth and
*  elevation in order to sample convection consistently over many degrees of
*  latitude.  A comp-scan samples a plane parallel to the magnetic meridian
*  but offset to the east or west and tilted off zenith (most commonly 25
*  deg).  The angular change rate may vary so that ground tracking is
*  constant, moving slower at lower elevation angles and faster near
*  overhead.  The azimuthal coverage may alternate between east and west of
*  the site while traveing in the same (northward or southward) direction.
*  For instance, the first scan may be the east comp-scan, from southeast to
*  northeast, and the second scan would be the west comp-scan, from the
*  southwest to the northwest.  Then the cycle repeats east comp-scan would
*  be repeated, followed by the west comp-scan, etc.  The scan duration is
*  normally four minutes, but that may vary with the experiment purpose and
*  ionospheric conditions.  The movement time between scans is less than one
*  minute.
**
*  Using the program VEL2CMPBIN, the data are ordered in such a way as to
*  combine the Vi's from one comp-scan with the Vi's from the same altitudes
*  and latitudes from the opposite comp-scan.  That is, the first
*  line-of-sight record from the first east scan is paired with the first
*  line-of-sight record from the first west scan.  Each pair of data gates at
*  the same altitude is combined to form the resolved velocity (using some
*  assumptions, which are addressed below).  Then the second line-of-sight
*  records from each of the two scans are used, then the third, as so on
*  until the last records from each scan are combined.  As each pair of
*  records is combined, they may produce values that overlap in latitude with
*  values from other pairs of records  as the data gates increase in
*  range, they also increase in altitude and distance from the radar site.
*  Each pair of records may cover some degrees of latitude, particularly at
*  the extremes of the scans.
**
*  After the data gates are paired from the matching line-of-sight records
*  from this very first pair of comp-scans (east and west), the first
*  comp-scan is discarded and the second comp-scan is then paired with the
*  third comp-scan.  The third comp-scan is then paired with the fourth
*  comp-scan, etc.  Each pair of line-of-sight records results in one output
*  record that has:
*    - the mid-time between the begin time of the record from the first
*      comp-scan and the end time of the record from the second comp-scan
*      (approximately 5 minutes for our nominal case), and
*    - the altitudes, latitudes and values of the east and north components
*      of the resolved velocities.
**
*  To accommodate real-time viewing of the data from this mode, the resolved
*  velocities from each pair of comp-scans are binned in 1/4-deg latitude bins
*  and averaged and computed as velocity magnitude and direction.
**
*  With this technique, we assume:
*    - V-parallel is zero,
*    - longitudinal homogeneity, and
*    - temporal stability on the order of some minutes.
*      Obviously, if there are longitudinal differences in the plasma flow
*      (for instance, due to a shear reversal that is not parallel to the L
*      shell) or a temporal change from one scan to the next (as would happen
*      with a substorm onset), then the validity of this technique is
*      compromised.  With good F-region signal, this mode can provide
*      convection measurements covering as much as 13 degrees of latitude.
**
*  Record types (KINDAT=) 15610 and 15630 are analyses of comp-scans.
*  KINDAT=15610 has the data parameters from each gate of each pair of
*  line-of-sight records used to resolve the ion velocity.  Each pair of
*  records used is at a different look angle and consequently spans a
*  different amount of invariant latitude.  Many differents pairs of records
*  may have meaurements over the similar invariant latitudes, as we consider
*  gates above 180km altitude to be a valid and representative measurement of
*  the F-region velocity.
**
*  KINDAT=15630 has the data parameters from each of the line-of-sight pairs
*  (used in kindat=15610) binned into 0.25 deg latitude.  Values between 180
*  km and 700 km altitude are used in the binning, and the contribution of
*  each is weighted by SNR.
**
*  E-REGION NEUTRAL WINDS ANALYSES (May 2003):
*  There are two versions some campaigns:  Johnson/Azeem (KINDAT=30024 in SON870921B)
*  and SRI's CWINDS with 4 KINDATS:
*    15115 neutral dynamics from combined pulses (92-196 km) E Nn Tex Tn Vi Vn
*    15116 electrodynamics from combined pulses  (92-196 km) Cond E J Ne Nn Tex Tn Vi Vn
*    15413 resolved velocity from longpulse      (93-1029km) E Ne Te Ti Vi
*    15414 resolved velocity from alternating code (92-555 km) Te Ti Vi
**
*  REPORTED MINIMUM ALTITUDES (Oct 2003):
*  The initial range gate may start below significant electron concentrations
*  for some combinations of antenna elevation and pulse length:  The minimum
*  altitude can be less than 50km with a low elevation angle, a (48km) long
*  pulse and initial range gate starting at 60-75km; such data are intended
*  primarily for the F-region and merely qualitative assessment of E region
*  range gates; e.g., is there an aurora?.  The shorter pulse (alternating code)
*  results have better height resolution for the E-region.

*  These are meridional neutral winds data.  They were prepared by SRI for Ray
*  Roble and Barb Emery (Jun 87); SRI refers to this as a WINDPORT tape.  No
*  header record was provided but a number of noteworthy remarks were in the
*  cover letter accompanying the tape:
*   (1) Vector velocities were derived from line of sight observations, also
*       calculated were average density and temperature profiles.
*   (2) No transmitter chirp correction is necessary for Sondrestrom data.
*   (3) The uncertainties for Vlos data were carried throughout the calculation
*   (4) No uncertainties were used for the densities, temperatures and their
*       derivatives.
*   (5) MSIS 83 neutral densities were also used to calculate neutral winds.
*   (6) In calculating the winds, the Schunk and Walker (1973) O+O-collision
*       frequency was multiplied by 1.7.
*   (7) About using the data (by Vince Wickwar):  Data he has presented were
*       smoothed by 1-hr running averages.  Sometimes there was also averaging
*       over a limited altitude region.  Although the meridional wind was
*       calculated to high altitudes, values are dubious above about 350 km.
*       In general the data are valid between the lowest altitude with good
*       signal to noise ratio and about 400 km.  Above 400 km the radar data
*       may be contaminated by hydrogen, the SNR is low, and the correction
*       for ion-neutral collision frequencies is enormous.  When using the
*       meridional winds, values are dropped when uncertainties exceed
*       150 m/s at Sondrestrom.

**
*      01 = dwells

**
*  I used the 9000s for unofficial basic parameters.  One the tape you
*  received, this code was used for the raw densities.  In the pre-MUSCOX
*  days, we did not send the raw densities.  I was not sure if we really
*  wanted to send them or not.  I'll check on that.  I should change the
*  code to something in the 5000s, if we want it available to others.
**
*  It won't hurt if a few people get the data while it still has the 9000
*  code, but they should contact someone here at SRI for an explanation.

*STS General Notes
*  St Santin IS RADAR operated from 1966 to 1987.  It was a bistatic system
*  through 1973 with transmitter at St. Santin and receiver at Nancay
*  (KINST=41), thus providing measurement of electron density, electron and
*  ion temperature, neutral-ion collision frequency, composition ratios and
*  ion drift quasi-parallel to the magnetic field line.  In 1974 tristatic
*  measurments commenced with addition of the Mende receiver (KINST=42) and
*  Monpazier receiver (KINST=43) for full ion drift vector determination.

*  Estimated hemispheric power from DMSP satellites prepared by Fred Rich.
*  KINDAT=31012.
*  May 2002: add new data, extending to 28 May 2002.  Although this
*  involved replacing data starting in 2001, a comparison revealed only
*  a few differences in the least significant digit (probably due to
*  rounding).
*  Feb 2003: 1999 data were replaced and new data added for 29 May 2002
*  to 23 Jan 2003.  CKINDAT text updated.
*  Nov 2003: Added satellite F11 to 1992 data; i.e. replaced 1992 data.
*  Jun 2005: Complete DMSP replacement of data from 1983 on to correct for:
*    1) Sensor degradations for F08-15
*    2) Re-calibrations for F11-15
*    3) Remove whole pass in NH if Thule cut-outs poleward of 50 magN
*       (This affected F10, F11, and F12 by cutting 23-52% of points)
*     (NOTE: F12 NH gone 95115-95228 and 96116-96226 because of sunlight
*      on photodiode that turned off the high voltage)
*    4) sunlight removal for F16 (actually high MEV particles removed)
*  May 2006: Complete replacement of F16; revised F13,14,15 2003-2006
*  Jun 2006: Revise F14-15 2001-2004 (more pts F1401,02 F1501,04; smaller Hp F1403,04 F1502,03)
*  Feb 2007: Add 06145-07052; F17 starts 06315

*  three spaced receivers and the full correlation analysis of Briggs (1984)
*  for computing the horizontal velocities.  As the irregularity patch moves
*  across each of the three receivers, it produces a diffraction pattern on
*  the ground.  The time shifts between each pair of the receivers will yield
*  an 'apparent' velocity.  Briggs' method of FCA (MAP Handbook Vol 13) takes
*  into account the random changes within the pattern as well as any preferred
*  orientation of the pattern thus yielding a 'true' velocity of the movement.
*  A triangular arrangement of the receivers permits a decomposition of the
*  resultant velocities into north-south and east-west 'wind' speeds.
**
*  This method differs from the Doppler beam swinging technique whose wind
*  analysis may presume that the vertical velocity is zero.

*  Fabry-Perot Interferometers observe night time airglow and deduce neutral

**
*  AFP early 1988 has 2 different versions, one submitted in 1991, and the
*  other in 1999.  There are 22 overlapping nights in January, March and July
*  1988, of which 17 have identical winds and other parameters, but different
*  background radiances.  The new background radiances are approximately half
*  the old background radiances, but the reason for the change is not clear.
*  (Background radiance is only important if it varies a lot, indicating
*  cloudy periods, which should have mostly been removed, anyway.)  Five of
*  the 22 overlapping nights contain different values of Code 4050, the
*  assumption used to determine the zero reference in the analysis.  When just
*  the zenith observations were used as a zero reference in the analysis, Code
*  4050 = 1, while for others, all of the measurements for a given night were
*  used (Code 4050 = 0).  The older submissions assumed Code 4050=1 (kindat=
*  17001), while the newer submissions assumed Code 4050=0 (kindat=17010).
*  The corresponding winds are somewhat different.  Finally, one of the 22
*  overlapping nights had a slightly different velocities because the free
*  spectral range (Code 4051) was 600 instead of 590.  In general, use the
*  more recent submissions (kindats 17010 and 17011).

*  Red-line observations at Halley Bay Antarctica with a Fabry Perot Interferometer.
*   John Emmert of NRL found in 2005 that the 1994-1995 data for
*   +E and +N winds were actually +S and +W winds.  The error arose
*   when the 1994-1995 data were listed as being +S and +E, but were
*   actually in the order +E and +S.  There was one operator for 1994-1995,
*   and also a sequencing change between 1995 and 1996.  The 1994-1995
*   data were corrected in direction in January 2006 at the request of
*   Martin Jarvis of BAS.

*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/ARO/Tepley.src
*  Arecibo (Craig Tepley) provided source code which processes raw ACF and power
*  channel data and converts to the I.S. binary format.  COS blocked 3 files.
*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/Chiu.IRI
/ISRADAR/PGMS/Chiu.IRI.cofcnts
*  The Chiu and IRI models.  The IRI model is Version 9, Aug 86; The IRI needs a
*  coefficients file as "/ISRADAR/PGMS/Chiu.IRI.cofcnts".  Files are COS blocked.
*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/efield
*  Art Richmonds electric field model subroutine (Richmond et al. JGR 1980
*  P. 4658).  COS blocked ASCII.
*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/MSIS
*  The MSIS model (version 1983 or 1986).  (COS blocked).
*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/SRI/subs
/ISRADAR/PGMS/SRI/spline
*  Some Fortran subroutines used by the SRI database software package.
*  "subs" has 15 files (4013 recs), including PLOTQ, VECTOR, WHEN, WHERE.
*  "spline" has 4 files: source, example input, terminal output and print
*  output.   Both are COS blocked ASCII.
*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/USUmodel/craybin.tar
/ISRADAR/PGMS/USUmodel/ascii.tar
*  The parameterized high-latitude USU model (as provided by Lincoln Brown
*  of Computational Physics) is available in two forms both are unix tar of
*  the 655 files comprising source code (*.f), documentation files (read.me
*  and order.lst) and coefficients files ($[NS]H* for ascii or [NS]H* for
*  binary version).  The coeffieients files in "craybin.tar" are Cray binary
*  version made from "ascii.tar"; the other difference between "craybin.tar"
*  (20 MB) and "ascii.tar" (35 MB) is additional remarks in "read.me" regarding
*  installation from tape.  These are NOT COS blocked files.
*
/ISRADAR/PGMS/readtp.vms
*  The Vax/VMS version of readtp; COS blocked 5 files (1779, 1454, 28, 29
*  and 114 lines long).  File one contains the fortran source routines and the
*  remaining four files are supporting VMS macros.  (RDBLK5 version).
