listed</a>.
<p>
The objective of the poster competition is to recognize
<b>STUDENT</b> contributions to excellent posters. 
Undergraduate and graduate students who are the first authors 
of poster presentations may <i>choose</i>  to participate in the
poster competition. Students desiring to compete <i>must</i>:<br>
<ol><li>register to participate when submitting their abstract
(checking the appropriate boxes on the 
Abstract Submission Form);</li>
<li>have their poster mounted in the designated space no later than 8 
hours <i>before</i> the beginning of the assigned formal poster 
session;</li>
<li>be at their poster for a 1-hour period during the formal poster
session (the time must be indicated
on or next to the poster at the time it is mounted).</li></ol>
<b><i>Failure to abide by any of these rules constitutes automatic
disqualification from the competition.</i></b>
<p>

Poster prizes will be awarded to the posters that best present results
of high-quality research.  
There will be two rounds of judging. 

<h4>Round 1: <i>Scientific Content and Effective Poster Presentation</i></h4>
Judging in this round takes place prior to the start of the formal
poster sessions, and is based on the judges' reading of the poster.
In preparing their posters students should follow the
<b>Poster Guidelines</b>
carefully, strive to provide evidence of familiarity with relevant
literature and/or work of others, and avoid diverging into unnecessary detail.
Only posters that effectively communicate significant research results 
and a high-quality research effort, without
benefit of an oral presentation, will advance to the second round of
competition. Visit the <a href="/workshop/ballota.html" target="cedarweb_aux">
First Ballot</a> link to see a
sample of the judges' first round evaluation form.

<h4>Round 2: <i>Scientific Content and Effective Oral Presentation</i></h4>
Judging in this round takes place during the formal poster sessions.
Students with competitive posters are evaluated further on the 
scientific significance and quality of the research effort, and also
on the
effectiveness of their complementary oral presentation. Students should
strive to:
<ul><li>
make an uninterrupted presentation in no more than 10 minutes 
(i.e., summarize)</li>
<li>
explain the poster logically (background, results, conclusions)</li>
<li>
make an independent presentation, without soliciting input from advisors
except for help with highly advanced questions.</li>
</ul>
