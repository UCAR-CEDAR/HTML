In anticipation of the TIMED launch in the Fall of 2001, the TIMED/CEDAR
science team is currently developing science operations plan for the initial
phase of the mission.  The intercomparison of space and ground measurements,
in particular, has been identified as one of the the highest priority tasks.
This workshop will be devoted to the observation and team coordinations
between TIMED spaceborne instrument teams and groundbased investigators.
The workshop will concentrate on the intercomparison of spaceborne (SABER,
TIDI, and GUVI ) and groundbased measurements.  The TIMED instrument teams
will present their validation needs.  The goal is to form the
intercomparison teams and to develop the observational strategies during the
initial phase of the TIMED operations.
