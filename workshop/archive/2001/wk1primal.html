<p>
This is the first CEDAR/PRIMAL workshop. The intent is to discuss, briefly, 
the various theoretical low latitude ionospheric models, their inputs 
and outputs, their similarities and differences, and their ability
(or lack thereof) to simulate low latitude ionosphere observations. 
<p>
The first half of the PRIMAL workshop will feature short presentations 
by both modelers and observers.  The modelers will describe their
models, focusing on the inputs required and the predicted quantities that result.
The observers will focus on specific data sets and the periods when 
the measurements were made, highlighting anything interesting or
significant.  Following the model/data presentations 
there will be an open discussion to determine general interest in the 
study and what initial projects seem to be the most relevant from a 
CEDAR Phase III perspective.  
<p>
PRIMAL is intended to follow in the footsteps of PRIMO (Problems 
Related to Ionospheric Models and Observations), the very successful 
CEDAR working group that compared the outputs from a number of theoretical 
models with mid latitude ionospheric observations from Millstone Hill. 
The PRIMO workshop culminated in a paper entitled "Intercomparison of 
Physical Models and Observations of the Ionosphere (Anderson et al., 
JGR, 103, 2179-2192, 1998).
