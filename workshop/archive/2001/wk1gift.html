<p>
The GIFT workshop was initiated at the 1997 CEDAR meeting to address issues in 
modeling the Earth's ionosphere.  Past years have focused on mid-latitude variability, 
forecasting the low latitude/equatorial ionosphere, and observation and modeling of the 
Auroral E-region.
<p>
This year the GIFT workshop addresses the global ionosphere and thermosphere from a 
different perspective.  Because major new initiatives are being undertaken to develop 
global data assimilation models, this year's GIFT workshop will feature tutorials on 
ionospheric and thermospheric data assimilation techniques, in general, and the use of 
Kalman Filter approaches, in particular.  The tutorials will be followed by general 
discussions by all participants with the goal of understanding how and why data 
assimilation schemes are so important in specifying and forecasting the global ionosphere 
and thermosphere.

<ol>
<li>Introduction   -   Jan Sojka

<li>Tutorial on Kalman Filter fundamentals  -   Ludger Scherliess

<li>Tutorial on Kalman Filter techniques applied to the neutral atmosphere  -  Cliff Minter

<li>General Discussion   -   All
</ol>
<p>
The agenda will include ample time for discussions and we anticipate that the ideas that 
result from these discussions will form the basis for an ongoing, enthusiastic exchange 
among the participants.  All interested CEDAR attendees are welcome.
