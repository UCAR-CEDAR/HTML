This workshop will describe what is presently available at the Johns
Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) to support the
needs of the science investigators in anticipation of the launch of TIMED in
late September 2001.
We will also give the status of support from the CEDAR
Database to the Ground-Based Investigators of the TIMED/CEDAR project.
The capabilities of the TIMED Data System will be
demonstrated on a laptop connected to the TIMED/CEDAR website.  The tool
used for coordinating ground and spaceborne instrument observations, the
TIMED Coincidence Calculator, will be introduced.  The software
installation, setup, and its capabilities will be demonstrated.
