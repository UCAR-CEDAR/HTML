<p>
This workshop will focus on the future, on ways that the Jicamarca
Observatory might attack some of the many interesting questions about
equatorial ionospheric physics that remain unanswered.
<p>
We will start with a brief description of new developments at the
Observatory (e.g., the SOUSY radar move, the upgraded on-line
digisonde, internet improvements).  This will be followed by an
overview of interesting science questions that Jicamarca might be able
to help unravel.  These two presentations together should take no more
than 30 minutes.
<p>
The remainder of the workshop will be devoted to short presentations
on planned measurements at Jicamarca, and questions and discussion
from the audience on any topic relevant to Jicamarca.  Some of these
presentations will be related to the rocket/radar campaign in Peru
currently being planned for 2004.  These talks must be BRIEF, however,
and should emphasize the physics and not the hardware details.  If you
would like to speak at the workshop, please send a short title and
description to <donf@ece.cornell.edu> and <wes@ece.cornell.edu>
