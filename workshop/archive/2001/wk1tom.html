Remote sensing measurements of the ionosphere and thermosphere,
regardless of the specific physical process under investigation, are
often of a line-of-sight integrated nature (e.g., photometric
brightness, and TEC). Theory and modeling, as well as monitoring
systems, however, are generally concerned with intrinsic volumetric
variables, such as wavelength-specific photon volume emission rate or
ionospheric electron density.  Tomography provides a framework for the
estimation of such multi-dimensional parameters from their
corresponding one-dimensional observables.
<p>
The impact of multidimensional tomographic imaging of atmospheric
regions is becoming exceedingly evident in the community, as a number
of scientific processes have been demonstrated to be most suitably
investigated by tomographic methods, and the data products of this
class of observational techniques are being assimilated into
atmospheric models.  Aeronomic phenomena that have been successfully
imaged and studied using these techniques include: ionospheric
mid-latitude trough, traveling ionospheric disturbances, and SAR
arcs.  Similar techniques have been employed at high latitudes for
tomographic imaging of the polar-cap ionosphere, and for recovering
two-dimensional distributions of auroral emission rates from
tomographic photometer measurements.  At low latitudes, reconstruction
of non-stationary ionospheric plasma irregularities have been
performed, and recent studies have demonstrated the tomographic
imaging of equatorial anomaly.  The results in each case point to the
viability of the technique in providing experimental information that
is not otherwise obtainable by conventional single point line-of-sight
observations.
<p>
In the recent years, a number of initiatives aimed at tomographic
studies of atmospheric phenomena have emerged, such as the deployment
of new receiver arrays for improved radio tomography at various
latitudes, ground-based optical tomographic experiments, as well as
space-based spectroscopic limb-scanning sensors such as those onboard
the ARGOS and the upcoming DMSP missions.  This workshop provides a
forum for the fusion of various approaches to tomographic remote
sensing of the atmosphere. Recent resuls will be presented in the
context of correlative studies with the more conventional methods such
as ISRs, as well as theoretical models.  Furthermore, technical
challenges will be investigated, and future campaigns planned.
