<p>
LTCS is an ongoing CEDAR working group that focuses on the mesosphere and
lower thermosphere, encouraging coordinated collaborative investigations
using a combination of observations and modeling efforts.
This workshop will focus on the observation and modeling results of the
LTCS campaigns. Discussion topics include:
<ol>
<li>TIMED/CEDAR collaborative studies -
   Assimilation of ground-based and TIMED satellite data for
   collaborative studies of tides, waves, etc.
<li>Geomagnetic activity -
   Effects of geomagnetic activity on the lower thermosphere manifested in
   LTCS datasets.
<ol>
<li>CEDAR-TIMED storm campaign planning.
</ol>
<li>Wind and temperature shears in the MLT region -
   Observational evidence of temperature and wind shears in the MLT region.
<li>Advances in Modeling of Lower Thermospheric Dynamics
<li>Advances in Observational techniques for Lower Thermospheric Studies
<li>Climatology -
   Update on the climatological paper bringing together our LTCS results,
   in preparation for the upcoming TIMED launch.
</ol>
<p>
Those interested in making a short presentations, please contact
either Roberta Johnson or Irfan Azeem by June 8, 2001.
