Space Weather Month is a month-long campaign interval during September
1999, that was conceived and coordinated under the auspices of SCOSTEP's
S-RAMP program. The campaign studies are structured into 6
sub-workshops, each of which communicate and share information within a
main campaign workshop (chaired by Janet Kozyra
(jukozyra@engin.umich.edu). The 6 sub-workshops and corresponding
chairpersons are: Prediction (G. Heckman), Solar/Solar Wind (D. Webb),
Magnetosphere (N. Fox), Ionosphere (C. Valladares and P. Wilkinson),
Atmosphere (A. Burns), and Effects (D. Boteler). Unique aspect of the
campaign are the close involvement of both the effects and predictions
communities and the close electronic collaboration between diverse
science communities necessary to investigate complex coupling processes
in the sun-Earth chain. It is intended that this workshop will be run
largely on an electronic basis through the web site
<a href="http://worktools.si.umich.edu">
(http://worktools.si.umich.edu)</a> with supplementary face-to-face meetings
in appropriate existing meeting venues. Participants are encouraged to
register at the UM worktools web site and to contact the chairs of
sub-workshops in which they would like to participate to be added to the
participant lists within these sub-workshops. All participants will
automatically become members of the main campaign workshop.
<p>
The campaign as a whole has the following 3 aims:
<ol>
<li>To investigate the dynamical response of the
magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere system to various solar and solar
wind drivers.

<li>To trace identified geoeffective solar wind drivers to their sources
at the Sun

<li>To identify the resulting effects on technological systems in space
and on the ground
</ol>
To address these issues, the approach is to compare well-observed events
during the Space Weather Campaign with a few other events selected to
address focused science issues:
<p>
Geoeffectiveness of storm drivers: To address this issue, we plan on
comparing the response of the MIA system to solar wind drivers during
the 15-17 September 1999 (S1), 19 October 1999 (S2), April 2000 (S3) and
July 2000 (S4) magnetic storms. S2 and S3 had similar solar wind drivers
yet produced different storm intensities (as defined by Dst*).  Whereas,
S3 and S4 had very different solar wind drivers yet produced similar
magnetic storm intensities. Of interest is how other geoeffectiveness
measures rank these events. The intended comparisons raise questions
about the roles of preconditioning and the saturation of the polar cap
potential drop, among other issues, and about how energy is apportioned
throughout the entire Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Atmosphere (MIA)
system in response to different solar wind drivers. This apportionment
underlies variations in technological system effects.
<p>
Storm-Substorm Coupling: One plan to address this issue in the campaign
is a comparison of the small magnetic storm on Sept 15-17,1999 with a
steady magnetospheric convection event. The goal is to examine the
response of the MIA system to storms with and without simultaneous
substorm activity. Included in this work will be studies of the effects
of prompt penetrating electric fields on the onset of scintillations at
equatorial latitudes and the distribution and effect of the disturbance
dynamo on the occurrence of scintillation. These effects occur during
major storms; do they also occur during substorms and the small storms
discussed in the next paragraph.
<p>
Relative geoeffectiveness of high speed streams during different IMF BZ
orientations: Two high speed streams were seen between 23 Sept 1999 and
30 Sept 1999. During the first, fluctuating IMF Bz was mostly positive,
whereas in the second it frequently reached negative values. There were
significant radiation belt fluxes in the second event but fluxes were
weak in the first. One question for this workshop is: what were the
ionospheric and atmospheric effects of the two events.
<p>
This workshop will concentrate on the ionospheric and atmospheric
aspects of Space Weather Month, although the discussion of linkages with
other disciplines is encouraged. It will be comprised of: a short
introduction to the Space Weather Month campaign, a demonstration of the
electronic tools that will be used during the campaign, short
presentations and finally a discussion period at the end of the
workshop.
