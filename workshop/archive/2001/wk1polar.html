<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This year's CEDAR workshop on Polar Mesospheric Dynamics will be used
to discuss observations and models of polar winds, temperatures, gravity
waves and thermal inversion layers.  In particular the question of why
mesospheric inversion layers are often observed at midlatitudes but
relatively infrequently at polar latitudes will be addressed.
Measurements of meteor winds from an Arctic site will be shown, and the
application of stratospheric gravity wave prediction models to the
mesosphere will be considered.  The workshop will end with a discussion of
how observations and models can be better used together to investigate the
polar mesosphere.  A list of the speakers and discussion topics is given below.

<h2>2. Speakers and Discussion Topics</h2>
<p>
The following individuals will give short presentations and lead the discussions:
<ul>
<li>Tom Duck - Mesospheric inversion layers at high latitudes
<li>Nick Mitchell - Observations of mesospheric winds and waves at Esrange
<li>Steve Eckermann - Model predictions of gravity wave activity
<li>Dave Fritts - The combined use of observations and models in studies
of the polar mesosphere
</ul>
