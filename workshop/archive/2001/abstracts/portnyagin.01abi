Abstract: 
In this topical talk some results of analysis of the MLT wind
measurement data, recently obtained during 1999/2000 years
at the longitudinally distributed chain of the Arctic radar
stations, are discussed. The measurement sites are: Andennes
(69N, 19E, MF), Esrange (68N,21E,MR), Dixon (73.5N, 80.5E,MR),
Poker Flat (65N,147W,MF), Resolute Bay (75N, 95W, MR). Comparison
of the monthly mean prevailing wind and tidal parameters for
the Andennes and Esrange shows that significant differences
between the simultaneous measurement results, obtained
practically at the same geographical location, but using
different techniques (MF and meteor radars) are still existed.
These differences prevent to study some fine longitudinal
effects in the seasonal behaviour of the Arctic MLT wind
parameters.  However, many important features of the the zonally
averaged dynamical processes in the Arctic MLT region as well
as the longitudinally dependent ones can be definetely
revealed using the wind measurement results from the existing
network of the Arctic radar stations.
