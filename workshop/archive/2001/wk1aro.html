<p>
As in previous years this workshop is intended to provide a direct means
of interaction
with our user community. This time we will be focussing on the status of
the dual beam capability
that has been recently completed. We will also discuss the direction we
are taking with our new
datataking system for the ISR and how that will increase our flexibility
in designing new experiments.
<p>
In the past we have had several successful campaigns that have involved
using our facilities
with a cluster of visiting instruments (examples include AIDA, COQUI 1 and
2, CIC) and
we believe that our new capabilities offer a great opportunity for having
one or more
similar campaigns in the near future. At this workshop we hope to begin
discussion
on what sort of campaigns our community should be planning.  We are also
planning
on having a 2 or 3 day workshop at AO sometime in the next year to discuss
both scientific
and technical aspects of dual beam observations and would like to get
input form the community
on the potential dates.
<p>
Finally, for our users this will be an opportunity to offer suggestion for
improvements, new
or potential new users should bring their questions or concerns to the
workshop or alternatively feel
free to e-mail me (sixto@naic.edu) with any questions or suggestions for
the agenda (especially if you
would like to say a few words about your project, or potential project).
The draft agenda is:<br>
<ol>
<li>Facility Status (New data taking, Dual beam, Status, Opportunity
for clustered campaigns, Two day dual beam workshop, Klystron issue,
HF, Database and realtime data viewing)
<li>Selected Science Highlights (LIDAR temperatures, Electron line,
Energy Balance)
<li>Visitor Presentations (Jose Rosado-Roman)
<li>Discussion of Proposal System
</ol>
