<p>
Magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling is a research area of common
interest for the CEDAR and GEM communities and one in which the CEDAR and
GEM scientists have their own unique research strengths. To foster
collaborative research in this special area, an M-I coupling initiative has
been supported jointly by the NSF CEDAR and GEM Programs. A joint M-I
coupling special session was held during the 2000 Fall AGU. This year the
GEM program will host a full M-I coupling session at Snowmass, Colorado but
the overlapping of CEDAR and GEM meeting times will largely prevent CEDAR
attendees from participating in the GEM discussion. We are convening this
workshop to provide a forum for CEDAR scientists to discuss M-I coupling
issues from a CEDAR perspective.
<p>
At high latitudes the magnetosphere and ionosphere are strongly coupled by
electric fields, currents, and particles. Energy and momentum are exchanged
as well with the neutral atmosphere. This workshop will cover broad 
aspects of M-I coupling of interest to CEDAR. We will also pay special
attention to the active role of the ionosphere/atmosphere in M-I coupling.
Possible specific topics include the significance for M-I coupling of
upward Poynting flux, field-aligned currents and Alfven waves of 
ionospheric origin, plasma outflow
from the ionosphere, small-scale ionospheric plasma and electromagnetic
structures, spatial and temporal variations in ionospheric conductivity, 
feedback effects of thermospheric dynamics on the M-I system, and
the neutral wind dynamo. A relevant CEDAR workshop titled
<a href="wkaqj.html">"High-Latitude Electrodynamics"</a>
will be held after the M-I coupling
workshop and the issues of the important drivers of
thermospheric and ionospheric dynamics and their effects
in plasma transport, ion drag, and Joule heating will be discussed in
details in the latter workshop.
<p>
The M-I coupling workshop will start with scheduled 
presentations of duration 10 minutes
or less. This will be followed by informal presentations (1-2 viewgraphs for
each) and discussions with a focus on the active role of the
ionosphere/atmosphere in M-I coupling. We will also summarize the activities
of the GEM M-I session. The workshop will conclude with a discussion of
CEDAR interests in M-I coupling and the ways in which the CEDAR community
can contribute to the joint initiative. If you are interested in giving a
presentation, please email the title or topic of your presentation (no 
abstract required) to either
Lie Zhu at zhu@theory.cass.usu.edu or Mike Ruohoniemi at
mike_ruohoniemi@jhuapl.edu. We encourage student presentations.
