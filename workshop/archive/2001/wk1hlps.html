<h2>HLPS Millennium Campaign Workshop</h2>

<p>
The workshop will focus on the observation and modeling results of the
Millennium Campaign. This campaign was run from the 14 to 28, January 2001.
Key periods already identified from the data are:
<ul>
<li>Sun-aligned arc dynamics: 18 January 0100 to 0300 UT
<li>patches: from 2300 UT of January 20 to 0200 UT of January 21.
</ul>
Of interest will be:
<ol>
<li>The possibility of quantifying irregularity structure and dynamics in
conjunction with both sun-aligned
arcs and patches.
<li>Observing the evolution of irregularities (and scintillations) at
different times along the trajectory of the large-scale structures.
<li>The cusp as a source of density and velocity structures.
<li>Determine the changes in the patterns of velocities and densities as
produced by changes in the components of the IMF.
</ol>
