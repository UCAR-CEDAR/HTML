<p>
Mesospheric airglow oscillations, with periods longer than a few hours,
are often considered manifestations of tidal perturbations. For example,
a 24 hour signature in equatorial O(1S) airglow observed by the WINDII
instrument has been attributed to the affect of vertical advection of
atomic oxygen by the diurnal propagating tide. Recently, 8-hr variations
have been seen in both OH airglow and temperatures at the Bear Lake
Observatory (41.9N, 111.4W) and dynamical fields observed by the Sondre
Stromfjord incoherent
scatter radar. It remains to be determined if these variations are
consistent with perturbations induced by the terdiurnal tide. The
relative roles of temperature, density and advective perturbations have
yet to be elucidated.   We invite all interested parties to contribute
relevant observations and/or theoretical results to a discussion of this
phenomenon.
<p>
We will adhere to a workshop format, with significant time available for
discussions. Presentations should be kept short (a few viewgraphs / ten
minutes or less).  Speakers and titles are:
<ul>
<li>Chris Meyer / Dan Marsh - Introduction and Modeling Results
<li>Irfan Azeem - Ter-diurnal waves seen in high resolution Sondrestrom
data.
<li>Shengpan Zhang - Tidal influence on the Oxygen and Hydroxyl nightglows.
<li>Lyle Broadfoot - New Insight into the Photochemistry of the Dynamics of
the Nightglow.
<li>Paul Berhardt - Wave-Like Stuctures in Tidal Ion Layers Near 120 km
Altitude.
<li>Richard Walterschied (Abas Sivjee) - Tidal and planetary wave
oscillations observed in airglow at high latitudes. 
<li>Tai-Yin Huang - (Possible) tidal signature inferred from WINDII O(1S)
data.
</ul>
