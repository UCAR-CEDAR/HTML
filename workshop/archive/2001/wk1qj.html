<p>
Electric fields and currents in the high-latitude ionosphere, along with
auroral electron and ion precipitations, are important drivers of global
thermospheric and ionospheric dynamics through ionization, plasma
convection, ion drag, and Joule heating.  Quantitative estimates of
these time-varying electrodynamic features on a global basis are needed
for realistic thermosphere/ionosphere simulation models.  Widespread
ground- and space-based observations, together with data assimilation
procedures, are beginning to provide such global estimates, but require
further development and validation.  Particularly important for
estimations of Joule heating are quantitative evaluations of the
influences of small-scale electrodynamic structures, spatial
correlations between conductivities and electric fields, and influences
of neutral winds.  This workshop is intended to facilitate information
exchange and coordination of efforts among scientists working in this
field.
