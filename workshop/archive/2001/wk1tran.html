<p>
This workshop will discuss various questions related to the physical
nature and energetics of sprites and related optical phenomena formed
as a result of strong electrodynamic coupling of tropospheric
thunderstorms to the mesospheric and lower ionospheric regions.
<p>
Sprites are spectacular luminous glows which occupy volumes in excess
of thousands of cubic kilometers in clear air above thunderstorms in
the altitude range ~40-90 km. Sprites often exhibit an amorphous non
structured glow at their tops, which gradually converts to highly
(predominantly vertically) structured breakdown regions at lower
altitudes. Sprites are transient in nature and last only a small
fraction of a second following intense positive or negative lightning
discharges (more than 90% of sprites are associated with positive
lightning discharges). It appears from space shuttle observations that
sprites occur over most regions of the globe (in temperate and
tropical areas, over the oceans, and over the land). To date sprites
have been successfully detected from ground and airborne platforms in
North, Central and South America, in Europe, in Australia and over
winter storms in Japan.
<p>
The subjects to be discussed include:<br>
<ol>
<li>Recent experimental & theoretical studies of sprites & related phenomenon
<li>The Imager for Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning (ISUAL) - new
satellite program to observe sprites
</ol>
<p>
Dr. Steve Mende (Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California
Berkelely) will present information on new exciting satellite based
observing experiment of Sprites.  In collaboration with the National
Chen Kung University of Taiwan and the Tohoku University of Japan an
instrument (ISUAL) is being built to be flown on the ROCSAT-2
spacecraft. The ROCSAT-2 project sponsored by the National Space
Program Office of Taiwan . The ISUAL instrument is an optical package
consisting of a camera and a set of bore-sighted photometers.
Currently the launch date is late 2003.
<p>
The workshop will provide an excellent opportunity to discuss 
possible collaborative opportunities and to start planning 
coordinated observations for the ISUAL program. Additional technical 
information on the ISUAL project can be obtained at
