<p>
We plan to discuss observations and theory/modeling of PSAT in the
ionosphere/thermosphere focusing on their effects in the momentum and
energy transfer in the M/I/T system. Possible topics of discussion will
include (but are not limited to):

<OL>
<li>Are there any well-established signatures of PSAT in the perturbed
   ionosphere?

<li>Does plasma turbulence produce any appreciable effects in the dynamics
   and energy balance in the ionosphere/thermosphere system? Can it compete
   with the standard Joule heating and ion neutral drag?

<li>Are there any indications of plasma turbulence in the stormtime subauroral
   phenomena (trough/SAID/SAR arcs)? If yes, how significant is its role?

<li>Recent achievements in explaining the formation of ionosphere plasma
   irregularities.
</OL>


<p>
It is supposed that several invited speakers will each present a concise
assessment of a specific topic (for 50% of the total workshop time), which
will be followed by discussion.
The invited speakers are:
<ul>
<li>
Yakov Dimant, Farley-Buneman instability and electron heating
<li>
Gurudas  Ganguli, Wave and Joule heating in the structured ionosphere
<li>
Parvez Guzdar, Turbulence and Transport in High latitude Plasma Patches
<li>
J.-P. St Maurice, What we think we know about plasma turbulence in the
ionosphere.  A theorist's biased view of observations
<li>
Michael Ruohoniemi, Properties of ionospheric plasma instability and
turbulence-like variability in HF radar backscatter
<li><a href="/workshop/archive/2001/abstracts/streltsov.01abw">
Anatoly V. Streltsov</a>,
Interaction of Alfven waves with a turbulence
above the auroral ionosphere
</ul>

<p>
Everyone interested in these problems, which may be less familiar
to the CEDAR community, are welcome to participate.
