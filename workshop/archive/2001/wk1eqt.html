In recent years, continuous sampling of the mesosphere by both UARS
satellite and ground based observations are used to study rapid changes in
the MLT region, especially around equinox period in association with the
transition from winter-to-summer (and vice versa) conditions. These
observations indicates the existence of large variations in airglow
emission rates in the MLT region in late March around spring equinox
(termed as "springtime transition" by G. Shepherd) (Shepherd et al., 1999;
Stegman et al., 1992; Stegman and Espy, 1998). For example, measurements
taken at Meteorological Institute of Stockholm University in 1992 showed
that the greenline emission rates tripled in about 3 days followed by
about 10 fold decrease in the next 3 days. A large change on a global
scale during the same period of time is captured by the UARS/WINDII
instrument. The ground based and, more recently, satellite temperature
retrieval (Shepherd et al., 2001) also reveals rapid temperature changes
around spring equinox that follow a temporal pattern similar to that found
in the green line emission rates. On the other hand, exceptionally large
perturbations in mesospheric temperature around fall equinox is recently
reported by Taylor et al. (2001). Within the observation period of
1996-1999, this is a quite regular feature and it is shown that a
temperature departure of up to 25-30 K from the nominal seasonal trend
during a disturbed period of ~3-4 weeks.
<p>
Certain planetary wave activities may be closely associated with the
equinox transition. Analysis of UARS/HRDI daytime horizontal winds,
temperatures, and nighttime atomic oxygen in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere shows that 6.5 day waves peak around equinoxes (Talaat et
al., 2000). Their study also shows that the horizontal structure of these
variables are indictive of the gravest symmetric wave number one Rossby
wave, and the analysis displays possible modification by the zonal mean
wind.
<p>
Numerical simulations using the NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere-
mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) were also
conducted to investigate possible mechanisms leading to the variations in
airglow emission rates and mesospheric temperature around spring and fall
equinoxes. It is found that mean circulation change and planetary wave
transience can affect the constituents distribution and temperature in the
mesosphere (Liu and Roble, 2000; Liu et al., 2001). Atomic oxygen
distribution, for example, is sensitive to the mean residual circulation
in MLT, which is critically dependent on the gravity wave forcing. Around
spring equinox, increasing eastward gravity wave forcing in MLT induces an
equator-ward/upward circulation, which decreases the peak atomic oxygen
number density in the region. However, the model simulation for the spring
equinox did not show the observed increase of atomic oxygen prior to its
depletion, probably because no planetary wave forcing is considered in
this simulation (Liu and Roble, 2000). In the fall equinox simulation (Liu
et al., 2000) on the other hand, realistic planetary waves are forced at
the lower boundary of the model. It is found that planetary wave
transience during the transition period can lead to fast changes in both
phase and amplitude of the planetary waves, and these changes may cause
large variabilities in local temperature measurements similar to those
reported by Taylor et al. (2001).
<p>
These observational and numerical studies suggest that the equinox period
may be a time involving rapid dynamical changes on vast spatial scales
(mean circulation, planetary waves, and internal gravity waves) in the
stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere. Therefore, more detailed
studies of the equinox transition may provide important insight into the
couplings of the dynamical processes from lower to upper atmosphere.
