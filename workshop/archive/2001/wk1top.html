The workshop focuses on ISR and optical observations of ions and neutrals in
the upper thermosphere, exosphere, and topside ionosphere, especially as
they pertain to:
<ol>
<li>    the dynamics and photo-chemistry that create them and account for
their altitude distribution; 
<li>    the processes that excite the O, H, and He emissions;
<li>    the processes that account for saptial and temporal variability in
</ol>
distributions of the light neutrals and their ions. 
Recent ion measurements in the topside ionosphere at Arecibo, Millstone
Hill, and Jicamarca are discussed, as are recent measurements of neutral O,
H, and He at Arecibo and Millstone Hill. Plans for new nested
experimentation at Millstone Hill Arecibo, Sondrestromfjord, and Clemson are
to be discussed within the context of current solar maximum conditions and
within the context of instrumental constraints and needs. Plans for chain
experiments including integration of new capabilities at new optical sites
along the chain (including Clemson Univ. and the NOAO Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Obsevatory near la Serena, in Chile) are also discussed.
Initial results from a new remotely operable photometer will be shown.
The session discusses recent of H 656.3 nm, He 1083.0 nm, and OI 844.6 nm
airglow measurements, recent advances in topside ionospheric modeling and
data taking at Arecibo, and recent topside modeling. Speakers are scheduled
to present data, modeling results, and a brief review of capabilities. All
others wishing to make short presentations pertaining to neutral excitation
in the upper thermosphere and exosphere, ionospheric composition and
transport, or facility capabilities are welcome. 
Current speakers include: Robert Kerr, Sixto Gonzalez, Chris Wilford, and
Joe Huba.
