<a name="SUM"><h3>Summary of the 2006 CEDAR Workshop</h3></a>
<p>
The CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions)
Workshop for 2006 was held at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
A total of 312 participants, 91 coming to CEDAR for the first time, came
from 67 institutions, 9 outside the United States and Puerto Rico.
There were 42 universities, 18 laboratories, and 7 small businesses.
Of the 124 CEDAR students and post-docs, 18 were undergraduate students,
and 11 came from universities or labs in Taiwan (4), Japan (3), Peru (2)
and Brazil (2).  There were fewer foreign universities this year compared
to previous years.
<p>
The Student Workshop was held on Monday instead of on Sunday, so three times the
normal number of non-students came or about about 40% of the audience.
The coordinator of the Student Workshop was the first year
CEDAR student representative Michael Nicolls of Cornell University, who just
graduated last May, but who still has a second year on the CEDAR Science Steering
Committee (CSSC).  The theme of the Student Workshop was 'Introduction to Incoherent Scatter
Theory, Techniques, and Coordinated Science' because the panels from the Advanced Modular
Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) are close to being ready for general use at Jicamarca
in Peru, and at Poker Flat and Gakona in Alaska.  The keynote tutorial was given by
John Sahr of the University of Washington on 'Introduction to Ionospheric Radar
Remote Sensing'.  This talk and others are available in .pdf form at

Everyone enjoyed a quick sandwich for lunch before talks were resumed in the
afternoon.  After 4 PM, the students had free time for soccor in the park, or swimming
and volleyball at the Fort Marcy Recreation Center under the direction of Carlos
Martinis of Boston University, who was the second year student on the CSSC.
Carlos also organized a salsa dance party Tuesday night, where Ilgin Seker of the
Pennsylvania University gave dancing lessons to students and non-students alike.
The new student representative joining Michael is Romina Nikoukar of the University of Illinois.
<p>
The plenary sessions started on Tuesday, with introductions and the CEDAR Prize Lecture
by Erhan Kudeki of the University of Illinois on 'Inchoherent Scatter Radar Perpendicular
to B'.  Three tutorials were presented on the following days by Michael Mendillo of
Boston University ('Comparative Aeronomy:  Thermosphseres and Ionospheres in the Solar System'),
Larry Paxton of the Applied Physics Laboratory at the John Hopkins University
on 'UV Remote Sensing', and Robert Schunk of Utah State University on the 'Ionosphere:
Past, Present and Future Problems'.  All these talks are available in .pdf form at

is the science report on the Low-latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (LISN)
by Ceasar Valladares of Boston College and
5 of the 6 CEDAR Post-Doc reports by Josef Drexler of Cornell, Lars Dyrud of Center for
Remote Sensing, Mitsum Eijiri of Utah State, Lara Waldrop of the University of Illinois,
Paul Withers of Boston University, and Tao (Titus) Yuan of the Colorado State University.
Peter Fox of HAO/NCAR also updated the community on 'The CEDAR Database and Virtual Observatory
Efforts'.  All the tutorials, student keynote and CEDAR Prize lecture are on video tape.

<p>
A special plenary workshop coordinated by Richard Collins of the University of Alaska
and Eric Donovan of the University of Calgary was on 'Frontiers in CEDAR Science:  A workshop
to develop campaigns that advance the frontiers in CEDAR Science'.  Copies of the
summaries by four panelists and the summary of community inputs given on Tuesday are
located at
<a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/splidar/CEDAR.html" target="cedarweb_aux">
	http://www.gi.alaska.edu/splidar/CEDAR.html</a>
along with 42 submissions from the community, 36 of which were submitted early enough
to be part of the summaries.  A follow-up session during a pizza lunch on Friday
opened the floor to comments from the audience.  Including the Student and Frontiers
Workshops, there were 28 workshops total, the same number as last year.
Final reports for most of the specific workshops are at:

<p>
There were 136 posters at the Wednesday and Thursday poster sessions, including
88 student posters (4 more than the record from last year), of which 63 took part
in the student poster competition.  Prizes were a certificate and a selection of
new and classic books collected by the poster chairman, Rick Doe of SRI.
(Thanks to the community for the selection of books!)  The judges picked
first place winners from each session, Michael Nicolls of Cornell University who
chose a book by Gurevich, and Kim Nielsen of Utah State University who chose a book
by Hines.  The second place ties were Alessandro Cerruti of Cornell (Schunk and Nagy book),
Romina Nikoukar of the University of Illinois (Rishbeth and Garriott book), Luke Moore
of Boston University (Chamberlain book), and Jeremy Riousset of the Pennsylvania State
University (Landau and Liftshitz book).  A special undergraduate award was also given
to Tanya Rae Phillips of the University of Texas at Dallas (Schunk and Nagy book).
<p>
Santa Fe Destinations arranged
most of the  extra-curricular activities for the 2006 CEDAR Workshop.
We took a 52-passenger bus from Boulder, Colorado to Santa Fe and back with
9 students and 2 non-students.  This bus was then used for trips and to take students
back and forth between Fort Marcy Suites and the Eldorado Hotel.
Santa Fe Destinations offered extra fee cooking classes and tours of Tsankawi Indian ruins,
Tent Rocks, and the Pecos National Monument.  We also
took the bus for a shopping expedition at Tin-Nee-Ann's Trading Company.
<p>
The 2007 CEDAR Workshop will return to the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe,
New Mexico June 24-29.
