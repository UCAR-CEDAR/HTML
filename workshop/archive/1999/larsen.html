The Coqui 2 campaign was carried out in Puerto Rico in February and March
1998.  The observations included in situ measurements from eight rockets
and ground-based measurements from the Arecibo Observatory incoherent
scatter radar, the Arecibo sodium lidar, other ground-based imagining and
optical instrumentation, and two coherent scatter VHF radars located on
the west end and in the southern part of the island.  The rocket and
ground-based data set includes observations of sporadic E layers,
turbulence layers, intermediate layers, sodium layers, and atomic oxygen.

Results from the analysis carried out to date will be presented, and plans
will be discussed for future data analysis and intercomparisons.
</p><p>
The first half of the workshop will include presentations by the various
investigators.  The second half will be devoted to discussion of the
results and detailed planning of future collaborative data analysis
efforts.
