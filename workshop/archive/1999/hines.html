<p>The point of departure for this workshop is the panel discussion that followed
Charles McLandress's tutorial presentation at the 1997 CEDAR meeting, and, 
more specifically, Dave Fritts's segment of the discussion.  That segment will 
be rerun via video (13 min), to set the stage, at the start of the workshop.</P>
<p>
There will follow a tutorial by Colin Hines designed to identify and elucidate
the roles of various types of nonlinearity because, contrary to common
perception, they are not all of a kind.  Instead, different approaches can 
lead to some degree of understanding of various nonlinearities separately. 
Most particularly, the Eulerian advective nonlinearity is peculiar to Eulerian 
coordinates alone: it can be avoided totally by use of Lagrangian coordinates.</p>
<p>
There is a corresponding Lagrangian nonlinearity that can be avoided totally 
by use of Eulerian coordinates.  No one in their right mind would advocate the 
use of Lagrangian coordinates when the latter nonlinearity is relevant by 
itself, and symmetry suggests that no one in their right mind should advocate 
the use of Eulerian coordinates to deal with the exclusively Eulerian 
nonlinearity, at least for mathematical developments.  On the other hand,
aeronomic observers deal almost exclusively with Eulerian coordinates, so 
they would want results of the mathematical developments transcribed to those 
coordinates.  As will be discussed, the consequence of doing so is the 
production of a small-wavelength (large-wavenumber) "Eulerian tail" to any and 
every broad spectrum.  If this tail is observed but not correctly identified 
as such -- as "wavulence" -- serious errors of interpretation can arise.</P>
<p>
The tutorial will be designed to elucidate the physical origins of the tail as 
well as its mathematical origins, in the hope of bringing understanding to an 
otherwise obscure area in the interpretation of middle-atmosphere wave spectra.
It should then serve as a basis for a more informed discussion of both linear 
and nonlinear theories of observed spectra, to which the workshop will next  
turn.  It is hoped that this discussion will help to make up for the fact that 
the 1997 discussion had to be terminated, because of time constraints, just as 
it was heating up.  With the extra time now available, some fireworks may 
result.</P>
<p>
At the moment, an open-forum form of discussion is anticipated.  However, if 
there are other new developments of concept that lend themselves to the style 
of a short tutorial that will clarify physical assumptions and consequences of 
former theories, or that will open up new theories, they will be considered for 
possible formal inclusion upon application to the workshop convenor, Colin 
Hines, at 15 Henry Street, Toronto M5T 1W9, Canada; phone 416-977-8355; fax
