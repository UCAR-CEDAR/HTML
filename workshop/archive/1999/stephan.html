Many of the reions of the solar-terrestrial environment are
coupled via interfacing boundaries, particle transport, and 
energy exchanges.  As space weather becomes an increasingly 
important initiative to CEDAR, a familiarity with research in 
the solar and magnetospheric regions is a requirement for 
understanding these interactions and inputs to CEDAR-supported 
research.  The 1999 CEDAR Student Workshop will begin with an 
introduction to the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling) and 
SHINE (Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment) 
communities.  We will outline the particular interests of 
these NSF sponsored programs, with emphasis on potential 
interactions and collaborations with the CEDAR community.  
This will serve as a rudimentary introduction to the Friday 
joint CEDAR/GEM/SHINE session, which will combine work from 
all three groups in a discussion of a single geophysical event.

The second half of the Student Workshop will be a tutorial 
discussion of waves in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.
Waves are an important component of the dynamics of both the 
neutral and ionized constituents of the upper atmosphere.  They 
exist in all sizes, magnitudes, and geographical locations, and 
can influence particle momentum and energy, develop into 
instabilities, and even be generated to probe plasma characteristics
and dynamics.  We will include a general description of the general
physics behind these wide-reaching phenomena, with a discussion of 
several specific waves types which are of interest to CEDAR students 
and scientists, including gravity waves and tides.

Finally, in response to the positive feedback we received from last 
year's workshop, we will hold an evening social at a nearby park 
(possibly another outing to Chautauqua ) where students can interact 
in an informal setting to discuss graduate school, classes, theses, 
or even just go for a hike and enjoy the mountain air.
