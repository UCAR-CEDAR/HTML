	<p>The workshop focuses on recent ISR and optical observations of
neutrals and ions in the upper thermosphere, exosphere, and topside
ionosphere, especially as they pertain to:</P>

<ol>
<li> the dynamics and photo-chemistry that create them and account for
their altitude distribution;
<li> the processes that excite the O, H, and He emissions;
<li> the processes that account for variability in their distribution.
</ol>
<p>	Recent ion measurements in the topside
ionosphere at Arecibo, Millstone Hill, and Jicamarca are discussed, as
are recent measurements of neutral O, H, and He at Arecibo and Millstone
Hill.  Plans for new nested experimentation at
Millstone Hill and Arecibo within the context of both upcoming solar
maximum conditions and instrumental constraints are discussed.  Plans
for chain experiments including integration of new capabilities and
possible new optical sites along the chain (including Clemson Univ. and
the NOAO Cerro Tololo inter american obsevatory near la serena, in
Chile) are also presented.
</p><p>
	The session begins with a discussion of our current
	understanding of OI 844.6 nm, 1128.6 nm, and He 1083.0 nm
excitation mechanisms, and features a comparison of current
photoelectron modeling capabilities.  Advances in topside ionospheric
modeling at Arecibo will be highlighted.  Seven speakers are scheduled
to present data, modeling results, and a brief review of capabilities.
All others wishing to make short presentations pertaining to neutral
excitation in the upper thermosphere and exosphere, ionospheric
composition and transport, or facility capabilities are welcome.
