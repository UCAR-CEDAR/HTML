	<p>The Arizona Airglow experiments (GLO) have served the purpose of their 
primary sponsor and are now available for general use.  It has become clear 
through 
previous shuttle flight activity that the experiment is very productive and 
needs a larger 
science team and a well-defined mission to take advantage of the GLO data 
product.  A 
new plan is being developed for continued use of the GLO instruments in a 
supporting 
role to ground based observers.</p>
<p>	A group of Canadian aeronomers have agreed to join a US team to present 
the 
GLOs to NASA and the Canadian Space Agency as an international program.  The 
proposal will be to continue flight on the Shuttle in a campaign mode in a 
collaboration 
with ground based observers.  The follow-on plan is to deploy the GLO on the 
International Space Station (ISS).  The Shuttle flights will give an opportunity 
to examine 
the effectiveness of the overflight data in complementing ground based programs. 
 These 
studies would be used to define the most effective use of the GLO facility when 
it is 
deployed on the ISS.</P>
<p>	The ISS orbit is inclined at 51º to the equator, with a precession of 
about 70 days.  
This is a good orbit for many aeronomical observations.  From the ISS/Shuttle 
altitude 
the limb tangent height of 100 km is depressed about 18º from the horizontal.  
This 
means that useful collaborative observations can be made with ground stations up 
to 69º 
latitude, well inside the auroral zone for half of the day.  This will allow 
overflight of 
most of the airglow, lidar and radar ground stations.</P>
<p>	The ALOHA/ ANLC-93 campaigns observed signatures of dynamic changes in 
the nightglow, and the spectacular gravity wave event described by Taylor et al. 
(1995) 
appears to be consistent with the sharp changes recorded often in GLO data. 
Taylor 
observed a transition in OH Meinel emission exhibiting a 50% jump in intensity 
in less 
than 4 minutes. The progress of the intensity pulse across the nightglow scene 
was 
estimated at 76 ms-1. This pulse occurred in about 18 kilometers of lateral 
distance, not 
unlike the scale suggested by GLO observations.  Notable wind shear in the 
persistent 
sodium layer near 90 km was reported during the ALOHA-93 campaign (Gardner et 
al., 
1995).  These dynamic changes suggest that the only way to complement the data 
from a 
ground site is to operate in "snapshot mode" to stop the action.  All of the 
relevant data 
must be acquired in a single overhead pass of the spacecraft, and for now, only 
the 
Shuttle is sufficient to the task because of the high data rate available to its 
instrumentation.  Although there would be only one pass over each optical ground 
station 
per night, the nightglow layer could be characterized by GLO above many ground 
sites.  
Complementary Shuttle orbits on either side of the ground site would supplement 
the 
integrated picture.</P>
<p>	The workshop will be an open forum to discuss the possibilities of a 
campaign 
approach and to pole community interest in this project.
