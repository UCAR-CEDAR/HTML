This workshop will begin with an overview of those parts of the TIMED
mission which overlap or compliment ground-based optical measurements.
Invited speakers will then discuss specific capabilities/scientific plans of
the various sites around the globe as well as how the ground-based and TIMED
data can be combined to further address the goals of the current mission.
There will be time at the end for open discussion.
