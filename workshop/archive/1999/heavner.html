The purpose of the Transient Optical Emissions in the Upper Atmosphere
workshop is to provide the sprites, jets, and elves community an
informal forum to discuss recent observations, analysis, and modeling
efforts.  The overarching theme of the workshop is morphology.  Three
main types of events are easily distinguished: sprites, primarily red
optical emissions (with blue tendrils at lower altitudes) occurring
above thunderstorms between 40-95 km, with duration on the order of 10
ms; jets, blue phenomena propagating upward from thunderstorm tops at
speeds of 100 km/s to terminal altitudes of 50 km with a duration of
200-300 ms; and elves, brief (1 ms or less) red emissions occurring at
the upper altitudes of sprites, associated with the electromagnetic
pulse of a cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning discharge.  One type of
sprite, columniform or "c-sprite", has been identified based on video
observers (Wescott, et al. 1998).  Using ELF/VLF observations, Reising
et al, 1999 have found two distinct types of sprites based on the
delay between the sferic from the causative CG lightning and a
signature associated with the sprite.  Observations of phenomena
lasting ~17 ms yet only reaching altitudes of ~50 km have recently
been reported by Taylor et al, 1999.

Initial efforts at morphological description of sprites have been
based on characteristics observed by imagers (Desroschers et al, FAGU
1995, Moudry et al, FAGU 1998).  The goal of the workshop is to widen
the scope of the morphological characterization of sprites, using
several measurements to aid in the classification scheme.  The
successful development of a classification scheme by a majority of the
sprites research community will lead to a published summary which will
be of use to all investigators.  Attention will be given to
understanding how the developed morphology correlates with the total
energetics of the sprites.
</p><p>
The workshop will begin with a brief (~10 minute) introduction to the
past decade of transient optical emission research, followed by the
presentation of an initial effort towards a categorical classification
of sprites.  All attendees are invited to present examples of
"challenges to classification", suggestions for the classification
scheme, or a brief discussion of a sprite observed by multiple
instruments and how the observations contribute to the classification
scheme.  Time permitting, current (summer 1999) observational efforts
(dates of observations, instrumentation) will be discussed at the end
of the workshop with the aim of increasing collaboration.

Please contact Matt Heavner (heavner@gi.alaska.edu) via email if you
are interested in scheduling presentations or have any input to the
workshop.  The workshop will provide two TV/VCR units (in order that
videotapes may be queued up at the same time video data is being
presented), a viewgraph projector, and laptop projection facilities.
