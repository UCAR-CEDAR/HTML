<p>The CEDAR Storm Study is a cooperative effort among scientists in the U.S.A. and overseas in the study
of
specific ionosphere/thermosphere storm intervals with particularly good data coverage. The
aim is to involve interested scientists with F-region/thermosphere data or modeling capabilities in
coordinated efforts to understand the coupled upper atmospheric regions at different heights and on a
global scale during geomagnetically disturbed conditions, in line with the objectives of the NSF CEDAR
Initiative. The disturbed periods chosen to date are those centered on the March 20-21, 1990,
June 11-12, 1991, May 1-5, 1995, Jan. 6-10, 1997 and April 10-11, 1997 Incoherent Scatter Coordinated
Observation Days and the November 2-11, 1993 Space Weather Interval.</p>
<p>
Our Storm workshop provides an opportunity for all those interested in ionosphere/thermosphere storms to: 
</P>
<ul>
       <li>Hear results of the latest research 
       <li>Discuss progress on the various projects dealing with each storm 
       <li>Identify new coordinated studies dealing with the six storm intervals listed above 
       <li>Discuss the adoption of additional periods for study, such as the September 24- Oct 1, 1998 and
	October 18-31, 1998 periods being discussed at the Solar-Terrestrial Coupling Processes
       <li>(S-TCP) Workshop to be held on Friday 18 June 
       <li>Discuss future plans for the CEDAR Storm Study program, including the next 3-day workshop which
	probably will be held in late March, 2000. 
</ul>
<p>
If time permits, collaborators on individual projects will meet in small groups to plan the next stage in
their joint efforts.
