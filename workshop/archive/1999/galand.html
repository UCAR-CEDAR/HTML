Originating in the magnetosphere, energetic protons in the keV energy 
range represent an important energy source upon the high latitude 
atmosphere. Their interaction with the ambient neutral species makes 
them a significant source of ionization; it also leads to the auroral
emissions, especially to H emissions, a typical signature of proton 
precipitations.
</p><p>
In 1994 Roger Smith had organized the "Proton Aurora Workshop". This 
meeting had focused on the observations and interpretation of the 
proton aurora signatures in the dayside and nightside aurora. It had 
addresses the aeronomical problems associated with the proton aurora 
and the need of combined experiments between space and ground and of 
theoretical results for the exploitation of the proton aurora data.
</p><p>
Since this initial proton workshop, considerable progress has been 
made in proton studies. As for the proton aurora observations from 
ground, optical instruments with much better resolution are now 
available. The data obtained have a resolution good enough to be 
analyzed by models which are today more comprehensive and so more 
suitable for such an analysis. Optical intruments aboard existing and
future satellites are going to reinforce the H emission observation 
database: the harvest is expected to bring a better global picture of 
the proton oval.
</p><p>
Using proton transport code, combined observations between a satellite
measuring the incident proton flux and ground-based instruments 
(radar, optical) have helped in the understanding of proton aurora 
data and have also shown the major role protons play in the auroral 
ionosphere. Using global models it has been possible to show the 
effect of proton precipitations on both the ionosphere and the 
thermosphere. Recent rocket campaigns in coordination with ground-
based instruments have allowed to validate the proton models and to 
progress in the analysis of proton aurora.
</p><p>
Today, it is not only time to have an overview on all the progress 
made since the last proton workshop. The present workshop is also 
intented to stimulate more interactions between people interested in 
proton aurora issues. We would like especially to provoke and 
encourage discussions concerning issues which are relevant to several 
aspects of proton precipitation, such as the characteristics of the 
incident proton fluxes deduced from satellite observations or the 
possibility to infer these fluxes from H emission observations from 
ground or space.
