<h1><font color=#ff0000> The Relocatable Atmospheric Observatory: Science Objectives
        and Possibilities</font></h1>
<p> Convenor: M. Sulzer<br>Thursday, June 17 01:00-03:05 PM
<hr></P>
 <p>
 This workshop follows a talk in the morning by Rich Behnke of NSF on
 the Relocatable Atmospheric Observatory. This new facility now in the
 planning stage improves upon the Polar Cap Observatory, allowing
 incoherent scatter radar observations at potentially all latitudes and
 longitudes. (Time at one site would probably be at least one year.)
 The workshop will begin with a brief description of the radar design,
 which is somehwat different from the PCO. It will continue with three
 talks on the science topics which the RAO could address, divided
 according to high, mid, and low latitude.  Attendees at the recent RAO
 workshop at NSF will deliver these talks, which are expected to be
 catalysts for audience discussion and input.  The workshop will
 continue with a panel discussion in which the panel members will
 discuss the results of the recent workshop and handle questions and
 suggestions from the community.
