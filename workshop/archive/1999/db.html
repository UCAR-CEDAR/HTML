Each CEDAR Database Access Workshop will start at 1 PM with a short
structured introduction to accessing data via the current web interface
(http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu), or via the interactive utility cmenu
using a cedar login.  This will be followed by a short demo on the future
Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) middleware web access including
plotting capabilities using the Interactive Data Language (IDL).  Several
handouts will be available on access, on guidelines for data suppliers,
and on possible image formats, as well as the new catalogue and other
documentation.  On Tuesday, the structured introduction will start with
guidelines for data suppliers (including TIMED).  The remainder of the
period is for one-on-one, hands-on assistance for those who wish to access
the CEDAR Database.
