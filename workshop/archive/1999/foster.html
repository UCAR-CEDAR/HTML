<p>The Wide Latitude Substorm Study has organized World Day observing periods
twice annually in April and October, beginning in Oct 1996. The focus of
these campaigns has been to address the integrated, global ionosphere - 
thermosphere response to and involvement in the substorm process. 
Real-time and interactive access to the data from a number of facilities
has been accomplished through use of Web-based tools and in collaboration 
with the SPARC (previously UARC) program. The 1999 WLS intervals form the core
of SPARC analysis and education interactive campaigns, and the Septemter 1999
WLS will be run in support of the Intermational Space Weather Month.
Event discussion will center on the April 27-29, 1998 WLS campaign observations,
during which a number of substorm events were observed in detail (e.g. the event 
at 23 UT 04/27/98 - 02 UT 04/28/98).</p>

<p>
Plans for the 09/99 WLS/SPARC/Space Weather study will be featured.
