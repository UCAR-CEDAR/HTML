The SPARC project is a next generation, web-based collaboratory for space
physicists and aeronomers. The project represents a continuation and
expansion of the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (UARC), in which
over a six-year period a team of space physicists, computer scientists,
and behavioral scientists evolved a suite of collaboration
capabilities to provide rich, real-time access to a wide variety of
upper atmospheric data and modeling resources. The SPARC project provides
access to data sources supplied by 20 different facilities which combine
to supply nearly 200 different real-time (or near real-time)
data and predictive products. The experimental complement comprises
ground-based instruments including the suite of incoherent scatter radars
[Sondre Stromfjord, Millstone Hill, Arecibo, EISCAT Tromso, EISCAT Svalbard
and Jicamarca], several components of the SuperDARN system, several
Digisonde stations, magnetometers, a riometer, and others. Satellite
based data sources include GPS beacons for TEC and scintillation
measurements, POLAR UVI and VIS imagery for defining the auroral oval
boundary, ACE IMF and solar wind measurements, most in real-time. Global
current and forecasted ionospheric and thermospheric parameters are
determined from operating a nested-grid version of the NCAR TIGCM model,
using as input, real-time satellite IMF measurements when available,
or ground-based Kp measurements when the satellite feeds are down. Real
time model operation is possible by employing multiple nodes of the SGI
Power Challenge at the Center for Parallel Computing at The University
of Michigan. An AMIE model description is also available from SwRI.

The proposed workshop will describe to the community the most recent
activity within the SPARC program. Topics that will be shared (with
possible speakers) include:</P>
<ul>
<li> Outreach activities - Roberta Johnson
<li> Real-Time TING model	-	Wenbin Wang or Alan Burns
<li> VRML views of TING	-	Paul Morin or Julie-Claire Parrish
<li> interactive software	-	Peter Knoop or Glenn Golden

<li> experiences from the April 99 SPARC campiagn -
				Geoff Crowley or Aaron Ridley,
				Xiaqiang Pi,
				Bob Spiro,
				Ennio Sanchez,
				Sixto Gonzalez,
				John Foster or John Holt
</ul>
<p>
We will also share with the community, the proposed direction that SPARC
will be taking for the future. This will involve setting new campaign
times as well as electronic workshop periods. Since the SPARC software
is designed to operate full-time, archival viewing of past campaigns
and mid-campaign periods is possible.
