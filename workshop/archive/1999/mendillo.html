<title>Atmospheres of Terrestrial Size Bodies (ATSB)</title>

<h1><font color=#ff0000>Atmospheres of Terrestrial Size Bodies (ATSB)</font></h1>
<p>Convenors:  Michael Mendillo and Andrew Nagy <br>
Wednesday 16 June 1999 1:00-3:05 PM
<hr>
</p>
<p>
Theme:	The solar system exhibits a rich variety of atmospheres on planets and moons comparable in size 
to the Earth.  The 
observational and modeling techniques applied so successfully in terrestrial aeronomy are also 
well-suited to the study of 
similar processes on other worlds.  In this workshop, we will explore the common themes, major 
differences, and varied 
experimental techniques needed to achieve a comprehensive study of how the terrestrial atmosphere fits 
into the general 
context of ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere science in the solar system.

<p>
Format:  An overview of goals, followed by a several invited summaries of applications of terrestrial 
aeronomy methods to 
planetary topics, and then a general discussion of issues and future plans.
