<h1><font color="#ff0000">UAF/ISR Facilities: New Developments and Highlights</h1></font>
<p>
Convenor: Donald Farley<br>
Monday, June 14th, 1:00-3:00 PM<br>
ECCR1B40<hr></p>

<p>
Summary: We will begin with SHORT (1 or 2 viewgraphs, 10 minutes or less) 
presentations from each of the five facilities (Jicamarca, Arecibo,
Millstone Hill, Sondrestrom, and EISCAT).  These should mainly describe
new developments and capabilities.  These will be followed by short
presentations (from anyone) that discuss scientific programs using the
facilities.  The emphasis will be on programs that make use of the
clustering of instruments at any one observatory and (especially) those
that use coordinated measurements from several UAFs ("chain" experiments). 
Some of these programs (e.g., storms) have workshops of their own, of
course.  If time permits, a short summary (or advertisement, depending on
which workshop comes first) could also be presented in the UAF workshop. 
The workshop length will be only 2 hours, so all presentations must be
short.  The goal of this workshop, in contrast to that of many of the
other CEDAR workshops, is to give the community an overall idea of what is
going on (especially new things) at the UAFs, rather than an in-depth
study of any particular science.
