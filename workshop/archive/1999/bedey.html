<title>Global Climatology of Meteoric Metals in the Upper Atmosphere</title>

<p>
Broad layers of both neutral and ionized iron, magnesium, and sodium (as
well as other metals) are known to exist in the upper mesosphere.
Observations have shown that the characteristics of these layers vary
considerably with season and perhaps with latitude.  Development of a
descriptive climatology of metals in the upper atmosphere entails
measurement of such features as column density, layer centroid height, and
the frequency of occurrence of thin layers.  A comprehensive explanation of
this climatology will require consideration of the meteoric influx of
metals, subsequent atmospheric chemistry, and the redistribution of metals
by various transport processes.  Much progress has been made toward
understanding this multifaceted geophysical phenomenon, but there remains
much more to be done.

At this workshop, a diverse group of researchers will share their
perspectives on various aspects of the global climatology of meteoric
metals.  The emphasis will be on the presentation of results and
interpretations rather than the description of experimental procedures.  The
main purpose of these scheduled presentations is to lay the foundation for
further discussion.  Time has been programmed into the schedule to allow
lively interaction, and participants are encouraged to come prepared to put
forward their ideas.
