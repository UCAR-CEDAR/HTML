<p>This workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussing new
developments and latest results from our investigation of the low
latitude atmosphere and ionosphere. It is being held in lieu of a
traditional MISETA or Friends of Jicamarca workshops with the hope of
appealing to their traditional audience but also to a more inclusive
one.  The contemporary emphasis on space weather has led to renewed,
broad interest in equatorial plasma instabilities and irregularities
and their effects on communication systems,
and this workshop is being called to address those issues in particular.</p>
<p>
The timeliness of the workshop stems in part from a series of
instrumental upgrades which are either existing or planned for the
equatorial zone. Upgrades at Jicamarca over the past few years have
led to at least a half dozen new observing modes which are greatly
expanding our appreciation of the aeronomic and plasma processes
underway in the equatorial {\em E} and {\em F} regions. Thanks largely
to MISETA investigators, chain science is underway in the equatorial
zone, fostered by additional and improved Fabry Perot
interferometers and a proliferation of optical imagers and radio
scintillation receivers throughout South America.  Our South American
colleagues have also contributed new instrumentation to the
investigation, including an array of ionosondes, a new coherent
scatter radar in Alcantara, Brazil, and a new round of ionospheric
investigations at the Piura radar. Finally, the last few years have
witnessed improvements to the NCAR GCM relevant to analyses of the
equatorial zone along with new computer models of interchange,
gradient drift, and Farley-Buneman plasma instabilities.</p>
<p>
The growth and evolution of {\em F} region plasma irregularities,
their effects on radiowave propagation, and our ability to forecast or
now-cast those effects based on ground based diagnostic equipment 
and space weather information has
been a focus of the equatorial aeronomy community within CEDAR. At
present, there is more instrumentation than ever available for
developing and refining prediction techniques. There also seem to be
more individual and group efforts (MISETA, EPIC, ...) than ever being
directed toward the forecasting problem. This workshop is being
organized in part also to familiarize the community with these
efforts. We hope that the workshop will culminate in a general
discussion of where we stand as a community with regard to forecasting
and of what additional diagnostics or models are necessary to
help the effort along.</p>
<p>
We invite presentations in any area of equatorial aeronomy
(experimental or theoretical, upper atmospheric or ionospheric) and in
particular solicit those presentations that may be space weather
related.  If you would like to make a brief presentation, please
notify Dave Hysell (dhysell@clemson.edu) or Mike Kelley
(mikek@anise.ee.cornell.edu) about your topic and come prepared with a
few viewgraphs.
