This year the GIFT Workshop (Global Ionospheric Forecasting
Techniques) will focus entirely on the low-
latitude/equatorial region. The basic theme is to determine
if ionospheric measurements made at an earlier local time or
another latitude/longitude can provide a useful forecast for
the equatorial ionosphere.  Implicit in this theme is the
ancillary question "How best to combine observations and
models to realistically forecast the equatorial ionosphere?"
During the first hour of the GIFT workshop the discussion
will focus on ionospheric observations which have been and
are being obtained that relate   both to the ambient
ionosphere and to scintillation activity and the coherence
of these quantities with longitude. The second half of the
workshop will discuss the theoretical ionospheric models
that are being applied to the equatorial region and the
ability of these models to incorporate specific observations
so as to provide realistic ionospheres at other latitudes,
longitudes and local times.  The agenda includes ample time
for discussion and we anticipate that the ideas that result
from these discussions will form the basis for an ongoing,
enthusiastic exchange between observationalists and
modelers.  All interested participants are welcome.
