Short Description:    The HLPS working group ran a
high latitude patches campaign during January 1999.  Data was obtained from
Sondre Strome ISR on the 14, 15, 16, 18 and 20 January and at this time the
1000 to 1700 UT period on 20 January is the prime period of interest.  Cesar
Valladares led this campaign from Sondre Strome and is leading the effort to 
bring together the data sets for this period.    The workshop will focus on these
campaign data sets as well as model predictions for the period.  Presentation
are solicited from scientists who have observations or model simulations.
Round table discussions will be held on the multi-station and multi-instrument
technique analysis of these campaign results.  These discussions will also lay 
the groundwork for the next HLPS campaign.  A topic of interest in this context
would be polar cap arcs.  Hence, we invited input on this topic from both
conjugate and satellite points of view to augment the observation data bases.
One specific aspect of these discussions will be initial HLPS efforts to 
collaborate with the "GIFT" (Global Ionospheric Forecasting Techniques) working
group who are attempting to apply or establish space weather metrics.  In this
regard, HLPS campaigns and model simulations are extensive and advanced enough
that a significant contribution to these metrics studies can be made.

Agenda:
1. Valladares. Motivation for the January 1999 High latitude 
campaign.
2. Pederson. ISR, digisonde, IMF data during the observations 
of Jan 20, 1999.
3. Ruohoniemi. SuperDARN Observations on Jan 20, 1999.
4. McEwen. Imager observations from Eureka
5. General discussions for future campaign on Dec 1999 or Jan 
2000

6. Doe. Tomographic reconstruction of Sun-aligned arcs.
7. General discussion on transpolar arcs. 
a) Their possible detachment from the auroral oval. Does it 
occur only for transpolar arcs or is more general for any 
polar cap arc. 
b) motion controlled by IMF By. Does IMF Bz needs a southward 
excursion?
c) Conjugacy. Is it possible to use ground-based imagers in 
addition to a satellite in the opposite hemisphere?
d) mapping considerations. Do transpolar and polar cap arcs 
map to PS, BPS or magnetosheath?
In the last 3 years there has been at least 4 papers that 
discussed some of these topics.  These 4 papers are listed 
below. It is strongly encouraged to review the 4 papers prior 
to the beginning of the session.  Upon request these can be 
mailed to the attendees of the HLPS session.  
The goal in this part of the session is to come up with a 
plan to experimentally (and theoretically if possible) 
resolve these issues.
