<p>
The CEDAR Storm Study is a cooperative effort among scientists in the
U.S.A. and overseas in the in study of scientific
ionosphere/thermosphere storm intervals with particularly good data
coverage.  The aim is to involve interested scientists with
F-region/thermosphere data or modeling capabilities in coordinated
efforts to understand the coupled upper atmospheric regions at
different heights and on a global scale during geomagnetically
disturbed conditions, in line with the objectives of the NSF CEDAR
initiative.
<p>
The current Storm Study covers a total of 8 ionosphere/thermosphere
storm intervals.
<p>
<ul>
<li>March 20-21, 1990
<li>June 11-12, 1991
<li>November 2-11, 1993
<li>May 1-5, 1995
<li>Jan 6-10, 1997
<li>April 10-11, 1997
<li>September 23-27, 1998
<li>October 18-24, 1998
</ul>
<p>
The September and October storms were added to the study after the
1999 CEDAR meeting.  Additional information about the CEDAR Storm
Study, including on-going projects, can be found at:

<p>
This workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to give
brief progress reports on their ongoing projects and identify new and
interesting projects.  In addition to the science studies, a portion
of the workshop will be devoted to charting the future of the CEDAR
Storm Study, including the planning of the 3 day CEDAR Storm Study
workshop at Millstone Hill.
<p>
Our workshop in Boulder provides an opportunity for all those
interested in ionosphere/thermosphere storms to hear results of the
latest research, discuss progress on the various projects, and
identify new coordinated studies.  As time permits, collaborators on
individual projects will be able meet in small groups to plan the next
stages in their joint efforts.
<p>
