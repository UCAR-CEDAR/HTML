<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This brief workshop will serve as an introduction of the Maui/MALT program to the community.  This special NSF/CEDAR-AFOSR joint initiative will fund science projects to use the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) 3.67 meter Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) at the Maui Space Surveillance Site for studies of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (hence, MAUI/MALT). Additional information about this facility is available at <A HREF="http://ulua.mhpcc.af.mil/">http://ulua.mhpcc.af.mil/ </A>.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The workshop will open with brief descriptions of the ground-based instrumentation being proposed for deployment to this near-tropical, mid-oceanic location atop the summit of Haleakala on Maui (20.71<SUP>o</SUP> N, 156.26<SUP>o</SUP> W, 3058 m altitude).  The floor will then be open to discuss both near and long-term scientific goals addressable by the instruments at this site, with a special interest on collecting scientific input from those outside the group of initial core proposers, truly turning this exciting new program into a community effort.</P>
