<p>
This workshop will discuss various questions related to the physical 
nature and energetics of sprites and related optical phenomena formed 
as a result of strong electrodynamic coupling of tropospheric 
thunderstorms to the mesospheric and lower ionospheric regions.
<p>
Sprites are spectacular luminous glows which occupy volumes in excess 
of thousands of cubic kilometers in clear air above thunderstorms in 
the altitude range ~40-90 km. Sprites are morphologically complex 
phenomena often exhibiting an amorphous non structured glow at their 
tops, which gradually converts to highly (predominantly vertically) 
structured breakdown regions at lower altitudes. Sprites are 
transient in nature and last only a small fraction of a second 
following intensive positive or negative lightning discharges. It 
appears from the space shuttle observations that sprites occur over 
most regions of the globe (in temperate and tropical areas, over the 
oceans, and over the land). To date sprites have been successfully 
detected from ground and airborne platforms in North, Central and 
South America, in Europe, in Australia and over winter storms in 
Japan.
<p>
The subjects to be discussed include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study
(STEPS-2000): Characteristics of lightning which produce sprites and jets<br>

<li>Total energies dissipated in the middle/upper atmosphere by sprites<br>

<li>Recent experimental & theoretical studies of sprites & related phenomenon<br>
</ul>
