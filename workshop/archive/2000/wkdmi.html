Over the past several years, W. Jeff Hughes (Boston University) and myself
have acted as convenors of a GEM Working Group devoted to the topic of
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.  The specific goals of this activity were
to identify the impact of the ionosphere and ionospheric boundary conditions
on the growth and evolution of magnetospheric processes.  While it is often
stated that the ionosphere is little more than a passive load on the
magnetospheric system, the potential impact of the ionosphere may be much
more significant.  There are those who even believe that the ionospheric
tail may be able to wag the magnetospheric dog.
<p>
At the GEM-2000 meeting, MI Coupling activities had matured to the point
that two working groups were formed to formulate GEM Campaigns devoted to
the topics of "Impact of Ionospheric Plasmas on Magnetospheric Processes"
and "Electrodynamics of MI Coupling".  Particular attention has been given
to how these campaigns might improve the quality and performance of
large-scale MHD models.  In this workshop, we will discuss the current
status and plans of these GEM campaigns and examine whether there is
complementary interest in the CEDAR community.  We will also consider CEDAR
and CEDAR/TIMED research activities and evaluate how they might contribute
to our general understand of M-I/A Coupling.  Topics under consideration
will include:<br>
<ul>
<il>    Processes leading to outflow of ionospheric plasmas<br>
<il>    High-latitude momentum transfer and Joule heating<br>
<il>    Ionospheric features mirroring magnetospheric processes<br>
<il>    Consequences of dynamically varying conductances<br>
<il>    Neutral wind dynamos<br>
<il>    Others???<br>
</ul>
The format of this workshop will be a number of presentations followed by a
general discussion.  If you are interested in giving a presentation, please
E-mail your title to Ray Greenwald at the address given above.  The
objectives of this workshop are to identify CEDAR interests in MI coupling
and complementary areas of CEDAR and GEM research.
