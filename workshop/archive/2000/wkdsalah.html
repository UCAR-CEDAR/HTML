<h3>BACKGROUND:</h3>
	A project has been approved for a coordinated observing program 
between the NASA TIMED satellite, expected to be launched in the 
February/March 2001 timeframe, and the NSF CEDAR ground-based 
instrumentation to investigate and study the effects of geomagnetic 
storms on the winds and temperatures in the Earth's lower thermosphere 
(~90-150 km).  These effects are not well understood at present due to 
the scant data base that exists from past measurements in this complex 
region of the atmosphere where many competing phenomena interact. 
<p>
	The main thrust of our project is to assess geomagnetic storm 
influences on the lower thermosphere using a carefully coordinated set 
of ground-based and TIMED satellite observations focused primarily on 
the 90-150 km altitude region. The ground-based observations are planned 
at incoherent scatter radar (ISR) facilities which can cover this 
altitude region, together with the clustered instruments at these 
facilities and at other supporting sites. General circulation modeling 
efforts focused on the investigation of these storm effects are an 
essential component of the project and will serve to enhance our overall 
understanding of the structure and dynamics of this region of the 
atmosphere on a global scale.  
<p>
	Our research project team includes members of the ISR and other 
ground-based facility groups, analysts familiar with the processing of 
observations from the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, experts from 
satellite-based systems including TIMED instruments, and thermospheric 
general circulation modelers. Interested members of the community are 
invited to participate.  
<p>
<h3>GOALS OF WORKSHOP:</h3>
<p>
	The purpose of the workshop is to kick off this new project and 
begin the detailed planning for the coordination of the ground-based 
CEDAR observations using various radar and optical systems with the 
TIMED satellite measurements during geomagnetic storms.  Our preliminary 
agenda so far includes the following topics:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of the CEDAR-TIMED collaborative project and plans (J. Salah).<br>
<li>TIMED satellite plans for data acquisition and distribution (S. Yee).<br>
<li>Discussion of ISR data reduction, schedule, and data base (L. Goncharenko).<br>
<li>Interactions with other observing networks participating in program (All).<br>
<li>Recent study of thermosphere storm effects observed by WINDII (S. Zhang).<br>
<li>Modeling activities for Sep 25, 1998 storm (I. Muller-Wodarg).<br>
<li>Discussion of previous plans for Sept. and Dec. 2000 campaigns (All).<br>
<li>Campaign planning for 2001 and best approach for data acquisition (All).<br>
</ul>
