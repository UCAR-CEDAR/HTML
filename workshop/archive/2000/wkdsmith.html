<P>This workshop is intended to explore opportunities for study of the mesosphere-thermosphere-ionosphere phenomena and interactions at high latitudes and make plans for campaigns to take advantage of them. In Alaska, there are several new instruments in operation or at advanced stages of construction. These include the Superdarn radars at Kodiak and King Salmon, the HAARP ionospheric modification facility and its supporting ground-based suite of instruments, the ionospheric tomography array being built by Mark Conde, the instrumentation at Poker Flat Research Range, the network of Fabry-Perot interferometers, meridian scanning photometers, auroral spectrographs, magnetometers and ionosondes. Similar arrays of instruments exist in Northern Canada, Greenland and Svalbard. We will consider the distribution of these facilities and instruments as a preliminary stage before considering actual projects.</P>

<P>Scientific opportunities already identified include Hyperspectral studies of the polar mesosphere (Mike Kelley), generation of ELF/ULF waves in the ionosphere (Umran Inan and Al Wong), Plasma structures in the ionospheric trough (Ed Fremouw), and Small Scale Structures in the Thermosphere (Mark Conde and Roger Smith). Brief descriptions will be given of these projects. Later in the workshop, we will have a brainstorming session to generate other possible ideas and develop a cooperative structure linking them to as to gain the maximum scientific benefits. The workshop leaders (Roger Smith and Mike Kelley) will be glad to hear from any contributors who would like to have some time on the agenda.</P></FONT></BODY>
