The GIFT workshop was initiated at the 1997 CEDAR meeting. Three specific areas 
of interest were identified; 1.) To determine the degree and sources of 
variability of the mid-latitude ionosphere so that we understand the baseline on 
which storm-time changes are imposed; 2.) To determine if measurements made at 
an earlier local time or another latitude/longitude can provide a useful 
forecast of the equatorial ionosphere; and 3.) To determine the temporal and 
spatial coherence scales in the various regions of the ionosphere that have 
implications for both observation requirements and model resolution. In 1998, 
the first two areas were discussed and last year the GIFT workshop dealt solely 
with the low latitude/equatorial ionosphere with the theme of how best to 
combine observations and models to realistically forecast this region.
<p>
This year there will be a joint, four-hour GIFT/HLPS (High Latitude Plasma 
Structures) workshop. The GIFT portion will focus on the auroral E region with 
presentations relating to 1.) Ground-based and satellite-borne sensors that 
observe the auroral E region and 2.) Empirical and theoretical models that 
calculate electron and ion density distributions in this region. The basic 
questions that will be addressed include 1.) The magnitude and spatial 
distribution of ionospheric conductivity, 2.) Auroral oval locations, 3.) 
Scintillation and clutter associated with the auroral oval and 4.) Electron and 
ion density distributions in the auroral E region.
<p>
The agenda will include ample time for discussions and we anticipate that the 
ideas that result from these discussions will form the basis for an ongoing, 
enthusiastic exchange among the participants. All interested CEDAR attendees are 
welcome. A partial list of presenters and topics is given below.
