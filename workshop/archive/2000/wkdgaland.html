<h2>THEME</h2>

Aurora and airglow are optical emissions induced, directly or indirectly, 
by electron and ion precipitation and by photochemical processes, respectively. 
They are signatures of the atmospheric constituents and of the energetics 
that excite them.  As a result, the analysis of airglow and aurora allow us to 
infer information on atmospheric composition, energy input to the atmosphere, 
and magnetospheric source regions.  Validation of models and a better 
theoretical understanding of aurora and airglow on Earth have been achieved 
through numerous in-situ and remote sensing observations and via laboratory
experiments.
<p>
Airglow and auroral emissions also have been observed on other planets and 
moons in the solar system.  The expertise acquired in terrestrial aeronomy 
can contribute significantly to studies of atmospheric emissions on other 
worlds.  At the same time, Earth's aeronomy can benefit from the diversity 
encountered in probing similar processes throughout the solar system.  
This workshop gives us an opportunity to see the context of terrestrial
optical issues from the view of comparative studies.
