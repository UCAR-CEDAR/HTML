A variety of techniques have been developed for studying waves and tides in
airglow, lidar and radar data.  Typically these techniques employ some
simplifying assumption about the atmosphere (e.g. the waves are linear
gravity waves that are freely propagating, or that the atmosphere is in
hydrostatic equilibrium).  Analyses of airglow, lidar, radar data sets
suggests that nonlinear wave dynamics may significantly effect the retrieval
of atmospheric state variables from the measurement.  The goal of this
workshop is to consider examples of these phenomena in both Rayleigh and
resonance lidar data sets and discuss methods for developing robust
retrieval algorithms and reporting for the data.  Several strawman data sets
will be presented that highlight different phenomena of interest.  The
workshop session will include prepared presentations highlighting specific
topics; wave-breaking and nonlinear interactions in lidar data, tidal
analysis of lidar data, mesospheric inversion layers and airglow-lidar
studies of waves.  We will present some initial results and invite workshop
participants to critically assess the techniques and suggest better ways to
analyze these phenomena.
<p>
Wave-breaking and nonlinear interactions:  Doppler wind/temperature lidar
data sets from Starfire, NM, will be presented to look at the wave dynamics
as represented in the sodium density, temperature and wind measurements. 
The data sets will be analyzed using non-linear models of gravity waves to
study the dynamics of wave breaking and wave-wave interactions in the data. 
These include identifying regions of instability in the data that yield wave
overturning as well as looking at critical layer effects.
<p>
Tidal analysis of lidar data:  Doppler temperature lidar data will be
presented to look at tidal signatures and how they can be retrieved.
Simulation results will be presented that show how the tides and waves
perturb the sodium layer.
<p>
Mesospheric inversion layers:   Both ground-based lidars and spaced-based
temperature sensors routinely observe perturbation temperatures that are
associated with pronounced deviations from the adiabatic lapse rate. These
include "layers" wherein temperature increases as a function of mesospheric
altitude on the topside, with bottomside lapse rates that are significantly
larger than the "unperturbed" state. Many of these so-called inversion
layers evolve in a manner that is wholly consistent with propagating gravity
wave, planetary wave, or tidal perturbations. We believe that it is
important to distinguish between simple wave phenomena and the distinctive
class of large MILs. We have initiated a study wherein the global-scale wave
model (GSWM) temperature variances are used as a threshold beyond which we
identify large MILs in Purple Crow Lidar data.  We will also provide a
strawman MIL definition and invite everyone to help us to better define
these distinctive phenomena.

Airglow-Lidar Studies
The OH airglow imager resident at the STARFIRE optical range provides a 
complementary look at the waves at the mesopause. The waves that
this instrument measures best are of a shorter period and horizontal
wavelength than those usually seen in lidar data. These waves are 
important contributors to the dynamics of the region probed by the 
sodium lidar, so understanding their distribution in frequency, phase speed,
and direction is important since the lidar results hold important information 
about the propagation environment of these waves. Summary results of this
distribution for recent campaigns will be presented.
propagation environment for these waves.
