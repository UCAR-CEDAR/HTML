<P>The CEDAR community annually selects a handful of scientific achievements from the past year to highlight in the morning sessions of our meeting.  This year, the number of excellent speakers who were nominated exceeded the available morning slots.  Since many of these had a common-theme of neutral dynamics, it was decided to present them in this afternoon workshop.  The speakers include:</P>
<DIR>

<P>John Meriwether, who will present a review of the mesospheric inversion layer phenomenon (Meriwether and Gardner, J. Geophys. Res., v. 105, p. 12405, 2000).</P>

<P>Miguel Larsen, who will discuss recent observations of persistent unstable shears and large winds in the E-region.</P>

<P>Anne Smith, who will discuss recent work on the terdiurnal tide (e.g., Smith, Geophys. Res. Lett., v. 27, p. 177, 2000; available on-line at <A HREF="http://www.agu.org/GRL/articles/1999GL010843/GL10233W01.html">http://www.agu.org/GRL/articles/1999GL010843/GL10233W01.html</A>).</P>

<P>Chris Meyer, who will present an investigation on planetary-wave penetration into the thermosphere via gravity-wave &quot;shadowing.&quot
(Meyer, J. Geophys. Res., v. 104, p. 28,181, 1999).</p>

<P>Maura Hagan, who will present highlights/&quot;hot issues&quot; from the recent Planetary Scale Mesopause Observing System (PSMOS) 2000 Workshop.  Additional information on PSMOS (a SCOSTEP project) can be found at <A HREF="http://www.hao.ucar.edu/psmos/home.html">http://www.hao.ucar.edu/psmos/home.html</A><B>.</P>
</DIR>

</B><P>The number of speakers in this special session was purposely limited, so time should be available for discussion (keeping in mind a workshop nature).  Additional workshops which discuss specific aspects of neutral dynamics appear later in the week and should provide ample time for further development and discussion of this topic:</P>
