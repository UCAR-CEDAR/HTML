Recent advances in observational capabilities and telescience technology
have greatly increased the scope and timeliness of studies of ionospheric
plasma convection at high latitudes.  It is well known that convection plays
an important role in coupling the atmospheric regions through its
association with field-aligned currents, large-scale electric fields, and
neutral atmosphere dynamics.  In this workshop we will discuss the
significance of convection in coupling the atmospheric regions and highlight
effects of particular interest to CEDAR (Joule heating, the ionospheric
dynamo, atmospheric gravity waves, etc.). Following identification of the
key scientific issues, we will discuss the design and implementation of
experimental modes suitable for their study.  The emphasis will be on the
coordination of operations between the suite of Incoherent Scatter (IS)
radars and the recently expanded northern chain of the Super Dual Auroral
Radar Network (SuperDARN) of HF radars.  The coverage of the HF radars now
provides, at times, nearly definitive determination of the large-scale
convection pattern over the European and North American sectors.  The IS
radar facilities can supplement the convection measurements and provide
observations of related effects in the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere.
We will define modes of operation for specific CEDAR and CEDAR/TIMED
campaigns and describe how the community can request this support.  We
invite presentations on the critical issues in high-latitude convection and
on the specification of radar operating modes that utilize the new
capabilities.
