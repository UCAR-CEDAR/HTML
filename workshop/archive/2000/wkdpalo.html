<h2>Motiviation:</h2>

It has become clear in recent years that future progress in understanding the 
coupled Mesosphere/Lower-Thermosphere-Ionosphere (MLTI) system will require the 
integration of diverse data sets from many different types of instruments located 
across the globe and in space.  
<p>
Assimilation of these data into a coherent result requires accurate knowledge of<br>
<ol>
<li>        Potential biases associated with specific measured and derived quantities
    (eq. temperature, winds, composition, emission rate, density, etc),<br>
<li>     The random stochastic fluctuations associated with a given measured or
	   derived atmospheric quantity, both the atmospheric and 
	   instrumental contribution are of interest,<br>
<li>    The coherence or correlation scale for a given atmospheric parameter over a
	   range of time and spatial scales.<br>
</ol>
<p>
It is necessary to have some knowledge of the random and systematic errors associated 
with all measured atmospheric parameters used in any  global analysis technique.  Without 
such information the validity of such analysis methods are questionable. Results from 
recent intercomparison studies in the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere have not provided 
clear answers about the errors and biases associated with specific measured quantities or 
measuring techniques.  One often-quoted reason is that "the two instruments are not 
measuring the same volume of space at the same time", this is also referred to as the 
apples and oranges argument. Therefore to make progress with these comparisons we must 
consider the question "How well do we expect two measurements of the same atmospheric 
parameter to agree?"  To get a handle on this question we must attempt to define the 
correlation structure for each measured parameter over short time and spatial scales.
<p>
<h2>Workshop Goal:</h2>

It is the goal of this workshop to bring together experimentalists and modelers to 
discuss the problem of random and systematic measurement errors.  
<p>
The following questions will be addressed<br>
<ol>
<li> What are the outstanding issues concerning measurement intercomparisons?<br>
<li> Are some methods for intercomparison better than others?<br>
<li> Do we need to take a stochastic rather than deterministic view of the MLTI?<br>
<li> Where can we make progress on this issue or what has been done and what still
	   needs to be done?<br>
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Schedule:</h2>

A short 15 minute presentation on previous studies and the current status of measurement 
intercomparisons will be made to bring people up to speed and to stimulate discussion.  
The remainder of the workshop will provide an open forum for the discussion of ideas on how
we should progress.  If you are interested in making a short presentation on this topic 
please let me know so that I can accommodate your needs.
