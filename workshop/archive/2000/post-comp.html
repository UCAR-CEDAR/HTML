<h1>2000 CEDAR Student Poster Competition</h1>

<hr>
</center>
<p>
The over arching objective of the CEDAR Poster Competition is to recognize
<b>STUDENT</b> contributions to excellent posters that demonstrate clear
relevance to the CEDAR program.
Effective June 2000 undergraduate and graduate students who are the first
authors of poster presentations may <i>elect</i>  to participate in the
CEDAR Workshop Poster Competition. Competing students <i>must</i>:<br>
<ol><li>register to participate when submitting their abstracts;</li>
<li>hang their posters during the morning break on the day of
their designated session;</li>
<li>be at their posters for a 1-hour period that they specify
on or next to the poster as soon as it is mounted during the morning
break.</li></ol>
<b><i>Failure to abide by any of these rules constitutes automatic
disqualification from the competition.</i></b>
<p>

A series of <b>OUTSTANDING POSTER PRIZES
</b> will be awarded to those students who best meet the
<a href=post-guide.html>Poster Guidelines</a>
along with the following criteria. Students should prepare to be judged in
two categories; 1) scientific content, organization, and effective use of
space, and 2) logic, timing, and clarity of expression.

<h4>Category 1: <i>Scientific Content, Organization, and Effective Use of Space</i></h4>
Judging in this category takes place prior to the start of the official
poster sessions and constitutes the preliminary round of competition.
In preparing their posters students should follow the
<a href=post-guide.html><b>Poster Guidelines</b></a>
carefully, strive to evidence familiarity with relevant
literature and/or work of others, and avoid diverging into unnecessary detail.
Only posters that effectively communicate CEDAR research results in
accordance with the 
<a href=post-guide.html><b>Poster Guidelines</b></a> and without
benefit of a verbal presentation will advance to the second round of
competition. Click <a href=ballot1.html>here</a> to see a sample of the
judges' 1st round evaluation form.

<h4>Category 2: <i>Logic, Timing, and Clarity of Expression</i></h4>
Judging in this category takes place during the official
poster sessions and constitutes the second round of competition.
Students with competitive posters are evaluated on the
effectiveness of their complementary verbal presentations. Students should
convey a clear grasp of the poster subject and a good understanding of the
importance of the results. Students should also strive to:
<ul><li>
make an uninterrupted presentation in ~10 minutes (i.e., summarize)</li>
<li>
explain the poster logically (e.g., background, results, conclusions)</li>
<li>
speak clearly; avoid "um", "er", "you know"</li>
<li>
make an independent presentation; avoid soliciting input from advisors</li>
</ul>

judges' 2nd round evaluation form.
