<h2>Background Information and More about the Workshop</h2>

<b>Meteoroid, Meteor and Meteorite</b><br>
<p>
Meteoroids are small solid objects that move in the interplanetary
space. They are in general smaller than an asteroid and larger than a
molecule. The trail of visible light, ionization or particles resulting
from meteoroid entering into the atmosphere is referred to as a meteor.
Most of the meteoroids intercepting the earth's atmosphere are solar
bound and have a velocity between 11 km/s to 72 km/s. Because of its
large entry velocity, a typical meteoroid evaporates completely at the
altitude range of 80 to 110 km when entering the earth's atmosphere.
Those meteoroids surviving the passage through the atmosphere and
reaching to the earth's surface are called meteorites. Very small
meteoroids that do not evaporate and falls through the atmosphere are
called micro-meteorite. Solar bound meteoroids have their origin in
comets and asteroids. The spectacular Leonids meteor shower is
associated with comet 1866 I (Temple-Tuttle). Leonids have been the
most extensively observed meteor shower so far by both radars and
lidars and will be discussed at the workshop.
<p>
<b>Meteoric Effects on the Atmosphere and Ionosphere</b><br>
<p>
Meteoric ablation is the chief process responsible for the existence of
metallic species found in the upper atmosphere. The most abundant
metallic atoms in the meteor zone include sodium, iron, magnesium,
calcium and lithium. Many of these metals can be directly observed
using the resonance lidar technique. The most abundant metallic ions
include Fe+, Mg+, Al+, Ca+ and Na+, which are largely responsible for
the existence of the nighttime E-region. At high latitudes, meteoric
dust are thought to provide the condensation nuclei for the formation
of noctilucent clouds. The chemistries involving meteoric metals are
fairly complicated. Prof. John Plane will give a review on recent
advances on meteoric chemistries. In addition, we will also discuss
direct meteoric impact on the atmosphere/ionosphere.
<p>
<b>Radar and Optical Observations of Meteors</b><br>
<p>
Other than space-craft observations, ground based meteor observations
can be largely classed into radio or optical method. In the radio
method, meteor echoes are obtained from the electrons generated through
the meteoroid ablation process. Meteoroids themselves are typically too
small to produce any detectable signals. Radar echoes from the
long-lived ionizations (e.g., > 100 ms) are called trail echoes. More
powerful radars also see the ionization that moves with the meteoroid.
This type of echoes are referred to as head echoes. Scattering from
meteor trails is better understood and this type of echoes have been
used to measure atmospheric winds and temperature.  On the other hand,
there are many unanswered questions regarding head echoes, both in
terms of scattering mechanisms and chemistries. Prof. John Mathews will
review the meteor scattering mechanisms at the workshop. Radar
observations from MF/HF to UHF wavelengths will be reported.
Electrodynamics of meteor trail evolution, which may have important
implications for interpretation of radar echoes, will also be discussed
at the workshop.
<p>
The latest addition to the observations of meteors is the lidar
technique. This technique has yielded interesting insights into
meteoric ablation process, size distribution, relative abundance of
different metals etc. There will be presentations on the latest lidar
observations at the workshop. In addition, there will also be a video
showing the spectacular observations made at the Starfire Range. The
stone melting video has been promised to be "cool"!
