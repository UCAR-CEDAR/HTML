Abstract: 
Using the Cornell AllSky Imager (CASI) located at Arecibo, observations of the 
6300A and 7774A airglow lines were made.  We present four nights during 1999 
where we have simultaneous incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements of 
electron density.  From the ISR data, we can model these two lines.  From the 
CASI observations, we can estimate the F-region parameters nmf2 and hmf2.  Two 
nights show good correlation between the ISR-measured and the CASI-observed 
parameters.  Marginal success was achieved on the other two nights due to 
discrepancies in the measured and modeled 7774A line, suggesting that some 
process was contributing to this line other than radiative recombination and 
ion-ion recombination.
