Abstract: 
The University of Colorado in cooperation with the Institute
for Experimental Meteorology in Obninsk Russia have developed a portable, 
low-cost HF (30 MHz) meteor radar for studying large scale dynamical features in 
the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere.  This system, called Cobra-1, operates 
without height resolution and is currently operational in Platteville Colorado 
(40N), Obninsk Russia (55N) and Dixion Island Russia (74N).  An upgrade to 
Cobra-2, with height ranging, is planned for the near future.  Our system and 
recent results will be described.
