Title: 
The Photolysis of Sodium Compounds in the Upper Atmosphere
----------------------------------------
Authors:

Abstract: 
Understanding of the meteoric sodium layer has been limited
by the difficulty in observing sodium compounds,
compounded with the difficulties involved in simulating
the chemistry in the laboratory.  Until recently, only the
atomic sodium was detectable by LIDAR at night and rocket
missions could detect cations, whose profiles models have
successfully described.  But new diurnal and seasonal
Na-LIDAR data have been collected at Urbana, IL, which
require this laboratory-based research on the sodium 
compounds, to discover how the sun affects the sodium layer.
