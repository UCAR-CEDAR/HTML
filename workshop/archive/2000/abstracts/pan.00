Abstract: 
In the summer of 1999, we conducted an Airborne Arctic Campaign with University 
of Illinois Fe Boltzmann temperature Lidar deployed in NSF NCAR Electra 
aircraft. With the capability of both night-time and day-time measurements, we 
obtained range-resolved mesospheric and lower thermospheric temperature profiles 
above geographic North Pole, measured temperature and Fe density over Arctic, 
and recorded Noctilucent Clouds (NLC) as well.
