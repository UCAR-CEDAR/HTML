Abstract: 
Electron densities and collision frequencies in the 60-100 km height range are 
measured using differential absorption techniques with the 1-km Buckland Park 
array located near Adelaide, Australia. The observed collision frequencies show 
significant differences from values calculated using laboratory-measured 
molecular cross-sections and observed atmospheric pressures. The discrepancy is 
resolved if new laboratory measurements of N2, O2, and O collision 
cross-sections for momentum transfer are incorporated. The effect is to 
significantly increase collision frequencies over previously used values, with 
implications for calculations of ionospheric current strengths.
