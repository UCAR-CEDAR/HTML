Abstract: 
The propagation of a Gaussian wave packet (comprised of as
many as 2000 individual monochromatic waves) through the
atmosphere is simulated using a spectral approach. Each of
the constituent waves is simulated using our full-wave
model. We assume a source height of 15 km. The perturbation
velocities, temperature, and density are input to a 2-D,
time-dependent, nonlinear chemistry model to simulate
variations in minor species and the OI 5577 airglow. In
addition to the fluctuating part, the response also consists
of a secular part forced by wave transience and wave
dissipation. We study two different wave packets and their
effects on the airglow and on the O distribution.
