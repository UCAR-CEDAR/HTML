Abstract: 
Measuring the GPS signals and determining the path TECs from
both of ground systems and a satellite receiver in Low Earth
orbit can provide a powerful means for tomographic reconst-
ruction of the ionosphere. In practice, the TEC data from a
network of ground-based GPS receivers can provide detailed 
information on the horizontal structure; OTOH, the available
occulting TEC data are sensitive to small vertical structure
of approximately a few kilometers. We have implemented the 
SVD method and the MART algorithm to regularize the inverse 
problem associated with ionospheric stochastic tomography.
