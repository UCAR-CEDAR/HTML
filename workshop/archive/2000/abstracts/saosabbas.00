Abstract: 
The relationship between sprites and lightning in their 
associated thunderstorms was investigated for a seven-day 
period (~700 events) during the Sprites96 Campaign. Sprites
occurred over storms possessing 7-17% +CG flashes, 
indicating that a high percentage of +CG flashes is not 
necessary for sprite occurrence. The average of the peak 
currents for sprite associated +CG flashes was higher than 
the one for all +CGs of the storm. However, the maximum in 
the sprite associated peak current distribution was at 40-50
kA. Approximately 6% of the sprites were associated with +CGs 
of less than 20 kA, lower values than previously reported, 
and 10% were associated with negative lightning.
