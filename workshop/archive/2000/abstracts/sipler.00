Abstract: 
A liquid crystal Fabry-Perot interferometer is a relatively
new optical device which has some advantages over the
conventional piezoelectric or pressure tuned
interferometers. Being electrically tunable, the device can
be easily and rapidly tuned by computer control. Since we
have an application for this device in a Doppler lidar
application, it was necessary to evaluate the stability and
repeatibility of the tuning. Using a frequency stabilized
HeNe laser, we found the device to be stable enough to use
for Doppler measurements to within the precision of the
measurement, equivalent to about 10 m/s.
