Abstract: 
The UARS Halogen Occultation Experiment(HALOE) uses solar occultation to measure 
nitric oxide (NO) up to an altitude of 130 km. Significant differences exist 
between sunrise and sunset HALOE observations. TIME-GCM simulations show that 
these differences are consistent with perturbations induced by the diurnal tide. 
Clear tidal signatures are present that are the result of vertical motions in a 
background atmosphere that has a steep vertical gradient in NO. In addition, the 
observed seasonal and interannual NO variability appears to be linked to tidal 
variability.
