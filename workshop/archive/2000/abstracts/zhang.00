Abstract: 
Neutral winds in the lower thermosphere between 90 and 250 km
during geomagnetic storms in April 1993 and February 1994 
were observed by WINDII on UARS through the daytime green 
emission. Wind speed increases to 700 m/s at 180 km in the 
polar regions, and winds in geomagnetic and local time 
coordinates show the familar two-cell pattern which 
penetrates down to 130 km. During the February 1994 storm, 
winds at 40S are much stronger than at 40N. The effects of 
the storms on the green emission rate at different altitudes 
and latitudes are also observed.
