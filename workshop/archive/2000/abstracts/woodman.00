Abstract: 
We introduce the first antenna "compression" scheme for coherent radars. The
idea is to transmit with a large array of coded antennas at full power, and
later synthesize by linear superposition and proper phasing (decoding), a
small transmitting antenna, similar to a single antenna element of the array.
This approach allow the use of all the available power in phased array systems
where either high power transmitters cannot be used with small antennas, or
the transmitted power is distributed among the antenna elements.
