Abstract: 
The luminosity of the Fabry-Perot Interferometer has been limited by the 
practical limit to which glass substrates can be ground to 1/100th wave or 
better and matched in an etalon.  Currently that size limit is around 8 inches.  
By constructing a mosaic of seven 80mm hexagonal etalons, (effective clear 
aperture of 350 square centimeters), Scientific Solutions Inc eliminates this 
classical Fabry-Perot aperture limit. The key to spectral coordination is the 
use of liquid -crystal as the index-changing medium within the etalon gap. A 
spectral resolution of 2.4 pm is achieved using a 4mm gap in each of the 
component etalons.  The total field of view is 0.11 degrees.
