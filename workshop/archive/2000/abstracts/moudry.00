Abstract: 
Nitrous Oxide(N2O) is an important greenhouse gas as well as 
a trace gas used to study atmospheric dynamics. Currently 
most sources of N2O are believed to be biogenic and anthropo-
genic. We propose sprites as a mesospheric source of N2O.
While this source is very small compared to the total (1 Gg:
10 Tg), the proposed mesospheric N2O density perturbation 
due to sprites above thunderstorms should be visible by limb
scanning satellites. In addition, the N2O chemistry could be 
indicative of further chemistry from highly vibrationally 
excited molecules.
