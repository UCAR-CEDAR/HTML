Abstract: 
Evidence now exists for the presence of a 3-day ultra-fast 
Kelvin wave in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Herein
we report on the airglow signatures consistent with this 
oscillation using an extension of an existing one-
dimensional finite element dynamical-chemical model,
which now calculates O2 atmospheric band and OH(9-3) 
emission rates in addition to the oxygen greenline.  The 
resulting peak-to-peak height-integrated emission rate
variations for this Kelvin wave during July are of order 
15-20% for all three emissions.
