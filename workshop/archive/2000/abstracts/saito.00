Abstract: 
Local time, seasonal and solar cycle dependencies of the 
traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) were studied with
 the total electron content observations by GPS receivers.
 GEONET (GPS earth observation network) in Japan have 
detected TIDs since 1997. At nighttime, the south-westward
 propagating TIDs are dominant, and their amplitude is 
larger in summer than in winter. TIDs were observed in the 
daytime to propagte southward. The daytime TIDs have larger
 amplitude in the winter season.  The anti-correalation 
between the TID activity and solar cycle was observed.
