Abstract: 
A time dependent three dimensional model of the polar ionosphere 
has been run for conditions of northward IMF over an extended period
(January 23,24;1998). The model results from the F region is used to study 
the associated ionospheric dynamics(UT effects etc.) over a spatial region
for comparison with data from the Sondestrom ISR. These comparisons are 
used to validate the model for possible future space weather predicitve
applications.
