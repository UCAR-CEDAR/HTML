Abstract:
Three types of solar wind structures are widely recognized:
Ejecta, high speed solar wind, and slow solar wind flow. 
Richardson et al (JGR, submitted, 2000) have classified the
solar wind observations for the interval 1972-1986 and compared
them to the AA index.  We use their classification scheme to
estimate the influence these structures have on the ionosphere
and magnetosphere by analyzing the Polar Cap Index, Auroral 
Electrojet and Dst response to these structures.  We attempt to
determine in some types of flows are more effective in energizing
the ionosphere versus the magnetosphere.
