Abstract: 
The adaptation of Imaging Doppler Interferometery to the dynasonde deployed at 
the Bear Lake Observatory enable the routine measurement of mesospheric 
dynamics.  Influenced by the direction of the prevailing wind, a clear seasonal 
variation is seen in the mesospheric echo numbers.  The techniques also provide 
a monitor for the amplitude of the main tidal modes as well as for studying 
planetary waves with periods between 2-20 days.  The observations are consistent 
with optical measurements from Bear Lake thereby confirming the IDI 
characterization of the mesospheric wind field.
