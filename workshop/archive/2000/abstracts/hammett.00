Abstract: 
We use a full-wave dynamical model and a steady-state, linear
chemistry model, to simulate gravity wave-driven airglow
fluctuations for the O2 atmospheric emission. Our primary goal
is to determine the effects of mean winds on the relative
airglow fluctuation amplitude, and we do so by using the mean
winds derived from the Horizontal Wind Model in our simulations.
Calculations are performed for nighttime conditions at 18
degrees north and for summer and winter solstice. The effects
of mean winds on the waves is a strong function of wave
propagation speed and direction. We therefore choose four
propagation directions (north, south, east and west) and a
range of horizontal phase speeds (20 m/s to 100 m/s) for a
single value of horizontal wavelength (80 km).
