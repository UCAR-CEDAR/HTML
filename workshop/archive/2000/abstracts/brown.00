Resolving Ambiguities in Gravity Wave Propagation Directions
Inherent in Satellite Observations: A Simulation Study

Abstract: 
We simulate space-based, limb viewing observations of
airglow brightness fluctuations caused by atmospheric
gravity wave interactions with the O2 atmospheric airglow,
and we demonstrate that due to the geometry associated with
such observations, the brightness fluctuations will always
appear 
stronger for waves traveling towards the observer 
(satellite).  The effect should be most noticeable for waves
having relatively small vertical wavelengths (~10km) and 
horizontal wavelengths of 50km or greater. Therefore, the
180 degree ambiguity in wave propagation direction 
associated with space-based observations may be eliminated
for waves dissipating in the upper mesosphere and lower 
thermosphere.
