Abstract: 
Recently a new excimer pumped dye laser was installed at the Poker Flat research 
range for use in a resonance lidar system.  For the past year this system has 
been undergoing characterization and testing using sodium.  The higher speed and 
beam quality of the new system has allowed new measurements to be made during 
this time and particularly during the Leonids meteor shower.  Upon completion of 
this testing process the lidar system will be used to make temperature 
mesurements of the mesosphere using atomic iron.
