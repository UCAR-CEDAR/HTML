Abstract: 
Meteor trails of increased ionozation created from dust to sand size
grains are frequently observed at E-region altitudes in the
ionosphere.  We present computer simulations and analyses of meteor
trails at a range of altitudes and angles with respect to the
geomagnetic field and a background electric field. We find that a
gradient-drift type instability forms on the edges of the trails and
develops into turbulence in ~1-5 ms.  This instability also drives an
anomalous perpendicular diffusion that increases with trail altitude
and density gradient, and may exceed the theoretical diffusion by an
order of magnitude.
