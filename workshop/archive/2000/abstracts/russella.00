Abstract: 
The spectral analysis of density fluctuations obtained with the
Purple Crow Lidar has shown that middle upper stratospheric temp-   
oral spectra follow the expected -1.5 to -2.0 power law to freq-
uencies of approximately 1/(15 min). At higher frequencies, the
shape of the spectrum is much more variable with strong quasi-
monochromatic features appearing intermittently on certain nights.
These higher frequency features have been attributed to nonlinear
wave interactions and suggest that estimates of middle upper strat-
ospheric gravity wave activity, energy dissipation, and eddy dif-
fusion values may be much larger and more variable than previously
assumed.
