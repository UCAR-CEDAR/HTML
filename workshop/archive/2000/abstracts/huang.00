Title: 
Investigation of Gravity Waves Using Starfire Data
----------------------------------------

Abstract: 
We performed gravity wave studies for the mesospheric 
region using data collected at the Starfire Optical Range, 
NM in 1994 and 1995.  These data exist for eight different 
nights (one in November, three in February and four in April
) and consist of observations of Na density, temperature, 
and horizontal and vertical winds measured with a Na 
wind/temperature lidar.  A preliminary analysis of the data
is presented.  Contour plots of Na density, temperature and 
vertical winds show considerable differences at different 
seasons.  Day to day variation is also apparent.  The time 
average of Na density and temperature for each day show that
 Na density is larger in winter and the temperature is 
correspondingly colder except for February 2, 1995.  On that
 day, the vertical profiles of the temperature and Na 
density show prominent wave-like structure and the 
temperature has a peak at 95 km that was not found for other
 nights.  Variations are obtained by subtracting the mean 
from the data (for Na density, temperature and vertical 
velocity) to study the effects of gravity wave 
perturbations.  Spectral analysis of vertical winds using a 
discrete Fourier transform is performed and wave 
characteristics are derived.
