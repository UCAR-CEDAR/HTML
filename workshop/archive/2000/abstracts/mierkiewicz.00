Title: 
Fabry-Perot Observations of the Hydrogen Geocorona
----------------------------------------
Authors:

Abstract: 
A new series of observations is underway to explore the phy-
sical processes which govern the abundance and transport of 
atomic hydrogen in the earth’s exosphere. Ground-based obs-
ervations of hydrogen’s solar excited Balmer-alpha emission 
line yield important information regarding the density, 
temperature, and kinetics of the emitting gas. Large gains 
afforded by the technique of Fabry-Perot CCD annular summing 
spectroscopy make this new set of observations possible, 
including the first detailed observations of the much 
fainter Balmer-beta line. Early results will be presented.
