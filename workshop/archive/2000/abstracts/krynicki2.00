Abstract: 
In an attempt to verify the possible depletion of atomic oxygen relative to 
molecular nitrogen, [O]/[N2], in the upper thermosphere due to large magnitude 
upward vertical winds, Fabry-Perot interferometer observations of the 
Doppler-shifted 630 nm atomic oxygen emission were gathered at Inuvik, NWT, 
Canada in conjunction with POLAR spacecraft UVI images.  Upon identification of 
large magnitude upwellings in the vertical wind time series, actual 135.6 nm 
atomic oxygen UVI images are compared with artificial 135.6 nm images generated 
from flux and characteristic energy data and UVI calibration information.  
Discrepencies between actual and artificially-generated 135.6 images before and 
after upward wind events may indicate depletions in [O]/[N2] in the upper 
thermosphere.
