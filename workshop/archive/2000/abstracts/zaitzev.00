Abstract: 
LT-UT mapping of the H component of ground magnetometer
deviations was introduced by Zaitzev and Bostrom in 1971 (Plan.
Space Sci., 1971, v.19, no.5, pp.643-649) and has become a standard 
tool in searching for equivalent currents. First of all it was adopted to
analyse the spatial-temporal distribution of polar electrojets
as inferred from AE-index stations. On the LT-UT maps of the deviation
of the H component based on the mean hourly values of the 12 AE stations
for the CDAW-1 interval (5-10 March 1970), we display
the planetary pecularities in the development of the auroral
electrojets.  There are two types of currents under LT or/and UT control,
the position of the maxima in the electrojets, overlapping of the
electrojets, and the dependence of the Harang dicontinuty on UT.
With detailed maps based on 6-min values we display small-scale
features in the space and time development of the electrojets.
The gaps in the network of AE-stations are the main limitation
in the mapping of polar currents.

LT-UT mapping can also be used for the analysis of the Dst variation.
For this purpose we use the latitudinal chain of stations: San Juan, M'Bour,
Binza, Tbilisi, Tashkent, Munitinlupa, Kakioka, Guam, Honolulu, Tucson.
The data from these stations during the magnetic storm of 5-10 March 1970 was
used for the LT-UT mapping of the ring current development.  The global    
features of the ring current were obtained including the assymmetric
development and the possible connection with the polar disturbances.
The prospects of using LT-UT mapping to monitor space weather
is also discussed. LT-UT maps can be produced in
real-time if the data are available in real time via the Internet.
