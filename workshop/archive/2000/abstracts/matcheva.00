Abstract: 
The electron density profiles of the ionosphere of Jupiter 
exhibit a system of thin layers in the region below the main 
electron density peak. We suggest that the observed features 
are signatures of propagating Gravity Waves and construct a 
non-linear numerical model of the ionospheric response to GW 
forcing. Our results show that GW with parameters inferred 
from the thermal structure of the neutral atmosphere can 
have a major impact on the plasma distribution, creating  
large peaks in the electron density. Wave driven electron 
fluxes and global implications are discussed.
