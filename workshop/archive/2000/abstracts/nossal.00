Abstract: 
The Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) Fabry-Perot has acquired
an extensive body of high signal-to-noise, consistently
calibrated geocoronal Balmer-alpha emission data.  Inter-
comparison of WHAM data taken over a year and comparisons
with past CHARM campaign data indicate a high level of 
stability in the measurements.  Modeling improvements and 
resolution of model/data discrepancies by Bishop, along with
the high signal-to-noise of the WHAM data and the multiple
viewing geometries of the observations have made it possible
for us to extract a "best fit" hydrogen density profile.
