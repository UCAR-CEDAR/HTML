Abstract: 
Neural network algorithms have been used in conjunction
with DMSP satellite data in a study of Equatorial Spread-F
(ESF) over Ascension Island.  DSMP satellite data were
processed and provided as inputs to the networks to deter-
mine if ESF prediction was possible.  Results of the neural
network studies suggest that the pre-sunset topside
ionospheric densities, temperatures, and velocities are not
significantly preconditioned for post-sunset ESF develop-
ment.  A possible explanation is presented as to the 
reliability of this approach as a predictor of ESF.
