Abstract: 
Equatorial plasma irregularities (bubbles) are a complex and
morphologically diverse phenomenon;they have been observed 
to have a wide variety of scale sizes, packing densities,
density depletion magnitudes,and edge gradients.Furthermore,
depletions can at times appear to be superimposed on large-
scale background modulations, while at other times they may 
appear as individual density depletions. The work presented 
here is used to determine characteristic bubble scale sizes,
scale size distribution as a function of local time, and the
relationships between spatial size and depletion magnitude.
