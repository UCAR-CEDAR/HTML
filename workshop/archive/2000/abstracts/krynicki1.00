Abstract: 
High latitude thermospheric vertical wind studies in the past have identified a 
correlation between the direction of the vertical wind observed and the 
observation site's location relative to the auroral oval.  Upward winds have 
been observed when poleward of the auroral oval, and downward winds when 
equatorward.  Vertical wind time series obtained at Inuvik, NWT, Canada by 
Fabry-Perot interferometer observations of the Doppler-shifted 630 nm atomic 
oxygen emission have been examined, using POLAR spacecraft UVI images to 
identify the location of the auroral oval.  The results generally confirm this 
correlation.
