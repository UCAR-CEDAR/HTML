Title: 
Electrostatic Potential Patterns in the High Latitude
Constrained by SuperDARN Measurements
----------------------------------------
Authors: 
S. G. Shepherd and J. M. Ruohoniemi

Abstract: 
The recent addition of two radars to the northern hemisphere
component of SuperDARN has significantly extended the area
in the high-latitude where measurements of convecting plasma
are made. Periods are now common during which measurements,
available over nearly 3/4 of the high-latitude region,
adequately constrain maps of the electrostatic potential
produced by an established fitting technique. During such
periods the solution for the global potential pattern is
insensitive to the choice of statistical model data used to
constrain the fitting.
