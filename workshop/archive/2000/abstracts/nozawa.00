Abstract: 
A comparison study of the auroral E region neutral wind is conducted  using
the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar observations
and Thermosphere-Ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics
general circulation model (TIME-GCM) predictions.
Daily mean wind as well as diurnal and semidiurnal tidal winds are
compared for three seasons such as summer, equinox and winter
between 95 and 120 km.  Fairly good agreement is found
in an altitude profile of the mean zonal wind
between the EISCAT observation and the TIME-GCM prediction
for summer, which blows westward
in the mesosphere and eastward in the lower
thermosphere in the TIME-GCM predictions.
This confirms the  gravity wave (GW) plays a role
in the dynamics in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere,
and its parameterization used in the TIME-GCM is well developed.
