Abstract: 
One of the key questions in space weather and ionospheric
modelling is the accuracy of the predictions made by the 
models.  We compare a month's worth of cross polar cap
potentials observed by the DMSP-F13 satellite in the 
northern hemisphere with the predicted patterns from the
Weimer model using concurrent IMF observations.  The
results enable us to judge the performance of the model
under various IMF conditions.
