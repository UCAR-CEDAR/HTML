Abstract: 
Total electron content (TEC) along the GPS ray path is 
derived from pseudoranges and phase delays of the dual 
frequency GPS signals. We have developed a new technique 
to remove instrumental biases and to derive two dimensional 
map of absolute TEC over Japan by using the GPS earth 
observation network (GEONET) in Japan, which consists of 
more than 1,000 GPS receivers. The estimated TEC from GPS 
shows similar diurnal and day-to-day variations as the MU 
radar TEC obtained by integrating the electron density 
profiles (100-1,000 km altitude).
