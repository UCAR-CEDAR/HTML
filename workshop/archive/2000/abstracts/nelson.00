Abstract: 
The locations of Utah State's Atmospheric Lidar Observatory (ALO) and the 
University of Western Ontario's Purple Crow Lidar (PCL) are at similar latitudes 
and dissimilar longitudes, with significant orographical differences.  A 
comparison has been made of mesospheric temperature profiles and adiabatic lapse 
rates from each facility and from two models, one empirical (1990 MSIS) and one 
theoretical (from Ray Roble), for four months in 1998.  The ALO and PCL 
temperatures are surprisingly similar.  The adiabatic lapse rates measured at 
each location are also similar, with small differences that can be attributed to 
a less stable atmosphere over the Rocky Mountains.
