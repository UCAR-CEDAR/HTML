Title: 
Dynamical processes related to the atomic oxygen springtime transition
----------------------------------------
Authors: 
Han-Li Liu and Ray Roble

Abstract: 
Both ground based and satellite observations have shown a
"springtime transition" in the night-time oxygen airglow
emission rates with a sharp net decrease over several days
around spring equinox. This transition is studied using the
NCAR/TIME-GCM year-run simulations. Model results show a
close relation between the this transition and the residual
circulation change in the mesosphere region during equinox,
which is in turn determined by gravity wave forcing. Varia-
bilities due to planetary waves and implications on the
stability of equinoctial mesosphere will be discussed.
