Title: 
Intermediate Layers and Associated Vertical Ion Drifts
----------------------------------------
Authors: 
R.L. Bishop and G. D. Earle

Abstract: 
Intermediate or descending plasma layers form on the bottom-
side of the F peak and slowly descend to altitudes near 
110 km where they can remain for several hours.  In the 
spring of 1998, Arecibo observed intermediate layers on 33
out of 35 nights of operation.  Using density data from 
these observations in conjunction with the continuity 
equation, we calculate the vertical ion drifts that are 
consistent with variations observed in the layer motion.  
These drifts can be related to meridional/zonal neutral
wind fields in the E region.
