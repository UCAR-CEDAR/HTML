Abstract: 
The incoherent-scatter radar at Sondrestrom, Greenland has been operated in a 
high-resolution mode to map thin sporadic-E metal ion layers. We report on 
studies of radar spectral data to estimate the mean ion mass within sporadic-E 
layers, in particular double layers where two parallel layers are stacked 
vertically with separations of about 2-10 km. Our objective is to determine the 
role and extent of lighter metal ions (eg Ca+. Mg+) in forming sporadic-E 
structures. The lighter metal layers should be reside just below the heavier 
layers which are mainly composed of Fe+.
