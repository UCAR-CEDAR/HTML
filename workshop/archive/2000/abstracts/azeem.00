Title: 
Estimates of Terdiurnal Oscillations at Sondre Stromfjord
----------------------------------------
Authors: 
S. M. Irfan Azeem

Abstract: 
Neutral winds derived from the Sondre Stromfjord incoherent
scatter radar data are analyzed to investigate the structure
of terdiurnal oscillations in the 90-130 km altitude
interval. Measurements obtained during the core period of 
Lower Thermosphere Coupling Study (LTCS) campaigns have 
been used here to investigate the variability of terdiurnal 
signal seen in the periodograms of Sondrestrom neutral 
winds. Correlations with the diurnal and semidiurnal 
oscillations (estimated from the Sondrestrom data) are 
presented.
