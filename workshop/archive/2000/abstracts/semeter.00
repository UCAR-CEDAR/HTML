Abstract: 
The distribution of optical energy in the auroral spectrum is sensitive=20
to the energy and temperature of the incident particle population, and=20
to ionospheric composition.  Photometric measurements of atomic=20
oxygen and molecular nitrogen emissions in the magnetic zenith have=20
been used to estimate characteristic energy, energy flux, and =
composition
scale factors.  With respect to such calculations the auroral spectrum=20
can be considered redundant; the spectral detail afforded by dispersion-
based instruments is not required.  Spectrographs and photometers also
do not provide the spatial context required for the proper =
interpretation of=20
measured precipitation with respect to auroral forms.  Auroral imaging =
is
the only diagnostic providing an instantaneous projection of =
magnetospheric=20
electrodynamics, and should be exploited accordingly.  Simultaneous=20
access to the spatial information of cameras, and the spectral =
dimensions=20
of photometers, provides a unique window into MI coupling in the auroral =
zone.
This was the motivation for the Simultaneous-sampling Multispectral =
Imager=20
(SMI).  The SMI is a fast narrow-field camera designed to image four =
selected=20
wavelengths onto a single detector simultaneously.  This poster presents =
initial=20
results from a campaign at Sondrestrom in March, 2000, involving=20
measurements of auroral structures by the SMI, the all-sky camera, a =
4-channel=20
photometer, and the incoherent scatter radar.
