Abstract: 
A new 50 MHz coherent back-scatter radar has recently become operational 
at the Eqautorial Space Obsevatory of INPE at São Luis (2.33° S, 44.2°W,
dip: -0.5°), in Brazil. Preliminary results from a 10-day campaign in 
December 1999 involving this radar and a digissonde are presented in this 
paper.The RTI maps of electrojet irregularities show short period (~5 minutes 
or larger)fluctuations and significant day-to-day variabilities. A notable 
chatacteristics is the midday descent in the altitude of the RTI pattern 
that resembles the duirnal pattern of the base hight of the q-type sporadic 
E layer observed by the digisonde and that of the of the well known 150 km 
echoes observed over 
Jicamarca  and Pompei.
