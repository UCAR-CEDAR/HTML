Title: 
Rayleigh Lidar Studies of the Arctic Middle Atmosphere
----------------------------------------
Authors: 
Laura Cutler, Dr. Richard Collins

Abstract: 
An engineering analysis of Rayleigh lidar system 
performance with sensitivities to operational parameters 
will be shown, with the main issue being that of the 
overlap of the laser beam divergence to the telescope FOV. 
A robust algorithm for density and temperature processing 
under a range of geophysical conditions, such as 
mesospheric inversion layers, will also be presented.  
This analysis will be using a three-year data set obtained 
at Poker Flat Research Range, Chatinika, Alaska.
