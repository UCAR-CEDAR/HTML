Abstract: 
The poster presents the first attemp to verify the relation
between intensity perturbation and vertical wind velocity of
acoustic gravity wave theorized by Swenson and Gardner.

Intensity perturbation is measured using airglow imager,
centered at OH band.  Vertical wind velocity is measured
using lidar.  Both systems are situated at Kirkland AFB.
