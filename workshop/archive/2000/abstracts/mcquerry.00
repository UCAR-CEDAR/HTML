Abstract: 
       Since its founding in 1966, the Platteville 
Atmospheric Observatory has been at the forefront of 
atmospheric science.  The observatory's purpose has 
broadened beyond its original use for ionospheric heating, 
by housing instruments including wind profilers, a MF radar, 
meteor radars, and hydrology instrumentation.
       In 1997, a Major Research Instrument Grant was 
awarded by the NSF, which has facilitated major upgrades, 
renovations and the installation of new instrumentation.
