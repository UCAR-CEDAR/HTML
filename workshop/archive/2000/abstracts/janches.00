Abstract: 
We present details of the entry kinetics of micrometeors in the upper atmosphere 
derived from velocity/deceleration  results found using the Arecibo Observatory 
430 MHz Radar (AO).  These results are obtained utilizing a Doppler technique 
that allows very precise determination of the instantaneous meteor velocity 
directly from the meteor head-echo.  With the velocity, the deceleration, the 
assumption of a spherical shape, and a mean micrometeoroid mass density we have 
obtained estimates of in-atmosphere particle sizes.  An estimation of meteoric 
mass flux into the upper atmosphere is reliably drawn.  The meteor energy loss 
is also calculated providing clues regarding the physical processes that these 
particles undergo during the time they are seen by  the radar.
