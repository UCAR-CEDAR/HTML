Abstract: 
A significant improvement has been made to the standard APL
technique of fitting ionospheric convection velocity data
to produce maps of the plasma convection in the
high-latitude. Velocity data are mapped into new
coordinates referenced to auroral arc boundaries determined
from UVI data on the POLAR spacecraft. The new patterns
produced with this technique preserve smaller-scale
features that are otherwise obscured.
