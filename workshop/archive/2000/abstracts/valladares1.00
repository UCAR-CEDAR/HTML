Abstract: 
This paper combines three data sets in an attempt to determine the general 
characteristics of the latitudinal distribution of TEC when equatorial spread-F 
(ESF) plumes grow and when they are absent. To determine the date and times when 
ESF plumes (or bubbles) have developed, we have used the range-time intensity 
plots of coherent echoes collected by the Julia radar in 1998. We have also 
employed records of scintillations from two sites (Ancon and Antofagasta) 
displaced in latitude by 12&#61616;.  The last data set comprises latitudinal 
profiles of TEC constructed from measurements from several GPS receivers located 
at South America, also for year 1998.
