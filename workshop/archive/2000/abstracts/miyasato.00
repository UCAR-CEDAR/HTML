Abstract: 
We carried out optical observations of sprites and elves at Maebashi in Japan 
from December 1999 to February 2000 with two multi-anode array photometers(MAP) 
and an image intensified CCD camera and other optical instruments. The two MAP 
instruments were equipped with filters, red(380-500 nm)and blue(560-800 nm), 
respectively. We succeeded in capturing spectral data for 4 events of elves 
during this campaign. Using these spectral data, we calculated the energies of 
electrons inducing elves, and we compared these results with the characteristics 
of elves observed in Colorado,USA.
