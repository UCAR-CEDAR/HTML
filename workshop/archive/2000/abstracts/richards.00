Abstract: 
Several studies have predicted up to a factor of 2
reduction in NmF2 as a result of significant amounts of
vibrationally excited N2 in summer at solar maximum.
Vibrationally excited N2 reacts much faster with O+
than does ground state N2. To study this problem,
we compare the FLIP model predictions of NmF2, with 
and without vibrationally excited N2, against
measurements at a selection of globally distributed
ionosonde stations over the solar cycle from 1976-80.
