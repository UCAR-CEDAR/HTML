Abstract: 
Latitudinal, longitudinal, and seasonal variations in the field-aligned and 
perpendicular flows 
measured at an altitude near 830 km, by the Defense Meteorological Satellite 
Program (DMSP) 
F10 satellite are examined. These profiles are studied during the nighttime 
(2100 MLT) for 
solstice periods in 1991 when the solar activity is very high. Latitude and 
longitude variations 
show the influence of F-region winds in modulating the observed field-aligned 
flows. At night, 
large downward field-aligned flows of the order 400-600 m/s are observed in the 
winter 
hemisphere and coincide in longitude with the location of previously identified 
adiabatic heating 
effects studied by Venkatraman and Heelis [1999a]. Interhemispheric flows at 
2100 hrs local time 
are seen to extend up to apex heights of about 1000 km during times of high 
solar activity. 
Perpendicular drifts however, are relatively invariant with latitude as 
expected.

The ability to combine latitude profiles of the ionospheric temperature, 
composition, and 
velocities at specific longitude and local time and comparing these to the 
available wind data, 
enables us to quantify the wind influence on the topside ionosphere and its role 
in affecting the 
interhemispheric transport of plasma across the equator. An extensive database 
of of nighttime 
F-region winds from Arequipa, South America, are also analyzed in the presented 
work. By 
comparing the daily variations in the topside with those seen in the F-region 
winds, we can 
uncover those changes that may be attributed directly to neutral winds.
