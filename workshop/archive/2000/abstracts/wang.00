Abstract: 


Radar echoes from 3-meter plasma irregularities of ionospheric sporadic E (Es) 
layer are analyzed and investigated in this article by using the Chunh-Li VHF 
radar. The interferometry result indicates that the Es irregularities extending 
from about 109 to 122 km are extremely aspect sensitive with enormously narrow 
aspect angle of กำ0.25ขX. After reconstructing the 3-dimensional structure of 
the Es echoes, we find that the object responsible for the radar returns is an 
isolated and solid blob-like plasma irregularity with elliptical cross section. 
The averaged lengths of the major and minor axes of the cross section are, 
respectively, 8.7 and 6.4 km, in which the major axis is basically parallel to 
the north-south direction and minor axis lies in the east-west direction. A 
comparison between the trace drift velocity Va deduced from the bulk 
displacement of the plasma structure projected on three mutually orthogonal 
planes and the true drift velocity Vt estimated from the least !
squared fit is also made.
