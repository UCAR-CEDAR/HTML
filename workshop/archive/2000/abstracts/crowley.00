Abstract: 
The Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure 
provides global maps of high latitude electric fields and conductances, from 
which the simple Joule heating (neglecting neutral wind effects) can be 
obtained. To determine whether these estimates are realistic, it is important to 
determine the accuracy of the AMIE conductances and electric fields. 
Historically, conductance data have been especially difficult to obtain for 
ingestion into AMIE, but recent POLAR UVI images have provided conductances on a 
global scale that can be ingested into AMIE. This paper demonstrates the 
sensitivity of the conductances derived by AMIE to the inclusion of conductances 
inferred from UVI, magnetometers and DMSP particle data for the May 1998 storm. 
The AMIE runs are tuned such that the dayside ionospheric conductances compare 
favorably with height-integrated values derived from measurements by the 
Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar. The UVI images promise to dramatically!
 improve the AMIE conductance and electric field distributions, and subsequently 
Joule heating by providing conductance estimates where no other data are 
available. The significant changes in AMIE conductances caused by the 
introduction of UVI data are described here. In addition, this paper provides 
the first validation of the UVI conductances by comparing them with conductances 
derived from DMSP particle data. Good agreement is obtained between the UVI and 
DMSP estimates.
