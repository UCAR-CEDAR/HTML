Abstract: 
This paper presents the analysis of data collected by the Jicamarca radar and 
the numerical modeling of the densities measured at this site.  The combined 
analysis-modeling has been performed for three data periods (November 23-25, 
1992, February 1-4, 1995, and May 1-5, 1995).  Density profiles were obtained 
from power profiles and normalized by the peak density measured by the local 
digisonde.  Profiles of vertical drifts have been also extracted from the 
Jicamarca phase measurements of the incoherent scatter signal.  We have used the 
Jicamarca vertical drifts to run the low-latitude part of the global theoretical 
ionospheric model (GTIM).  The model runs have been conducted first using drifts 
values averaged in altitude and then using the drift profiles.  In general the 
agreement between the modeled and the measured peak density is very good.  A 
better agreement is achieved using drift profiles instead of the averaged 
values.  We also present TEC values measured from a new G!
PS station located at Iquitos, Peru (Lat. = 03&#61616; 46.0 S, Long = 73&#61616; 
16.5 W, Alt =135.0 m). Data collected from this station reflect the typical 
diurnal pattern of TEC variations seen at low-latitude stations. TEC depletions 
were observed on some of the nights.  The GTIM model also provides the densities 
at latitudes between +20&#61616; and -20&#61616; from the magnetic equator.  
This allows us to model TEC values of stations located away from the magnetic 
equator such as Iquitos.  We also present a comparison of modeled TEC values and 
measurements of TEC at stations away from the equator.
