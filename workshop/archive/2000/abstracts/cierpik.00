Abstract: 
The purpose of this investigation is to use combined ground-based and 
space-based 
measurements of winds to derive the migrating and nonmigrating semidiurnal tidal 
components in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere between 50-55N.  To better 
understand the aliasing and sampling issues, a mock data set is formed by 
sampling 
the Kyushu University GCM output from both the ground and satellite 
perspectives, and 
analyzed in the same manner as the actual measurements.  Comparisons with full 
analysis 
of the GCM provides insight into uncertainties connected with the true 
measurement
analysis.  Particular attention is devoted to extracting the month-to-month 
variability
of the tidal components and their longitudinal structure.
