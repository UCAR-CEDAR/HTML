Abstract: 
Near-simultaneous observations of topside O+ parallel flows 
are presented for four periods of measurement by POLAR and 
DMSP satellites during April 1996. These observations provide
a view of wide-spread upward/downward ionospheric O+ flows 
over the broad polar region along extended and multiple 
distinct satellite tracks. We have also examined the dual 
altitude parameter measurements approximately 30 minutes 
apart for a polar cap field line, and compared them with 
results from a transport simulation in which a flux tube 
was subjected to a brief pulse of soft electron precipitation
and topside transverse ion heating.The simulated density and
velocity altitude profiles for approximately 20 minutes after
pulse generally matched the observations.
