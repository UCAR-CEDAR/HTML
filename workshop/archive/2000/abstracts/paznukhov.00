Abstract: 
This research was aimed at developing a new technique for
measuring vertical plasma motion. Using a Digisonde, it is
possible to derive an apparent velocity from the movement of
plasma isodensity contours. However, this does not represent
the true plasma drift speed since chemical processes also
contribute to the changing plasma density contours. We solve
the continuity equation in order to separate the plasma drift
from the chemistry. The comparison between vertical drift
velocities calculated by this technique and measured with the
collocated incoherent scatter radar shows good
correspondence.
