<hr></P>

<P>The Arecibo Observatory is a national facility that is located in Puerto Rico and is part of the Incoherent Scatter Radar/Upper Atmospheric Facility (ISR/UAF) chain.  It has the most sensitive (highest signal-to-noise ratio) radar in the chain and also has an extensive collection of passive and active (lidar) optical instruments.</P>

<P>Recent and soon to be implemented new capabilities at Arecibo open up exciting new opportunities for observations.  In addition to discussing current and future campaigns, we will describe the expected impact of (1) our new dual beam 430 MHz radar system (scheduled for completion this summer), and (2) the more powerful Nd:YAG dye and Alexandrite lidars and some improved passive optical systems.  The dual radar (line feed and Gregorian reflector feed) will provide improved temporal and spatial resolution for any measurement involving beam swinging and horizontal structure.  We expect a substantial improvement in the vector drift velocity measurements, for example.  The wide bandwidth of the Gregorian feed will permit plasma line studies over a wider range of frequencies than in past.  The lidar improvements will greatly benefit the study of metallic layers in the lower ionosphere.</P>

<P>There will be brief presentations on these and other capabilities, with a few illustrations from recent and on-going campaigns.  We intend to avoid mini AGU-like talks, however, and to allow ample time for questions and discussion.  The goal is to encourage more use of Arecibo facilities and Arecibo data by students and other outside users.  If you have questions about Arecibo or suggestions for ways that Arecibo can better contribute to the CEDAR community, please come and let us know.</P></FONT></BODY>
