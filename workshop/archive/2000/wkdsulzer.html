<hr></P>

The main idea of this year's database workshop
is to let the data providers host the workshop.  The original
idea involving the CEDAR database has grown quite a bit, and really now
extends to any web access of data useful to CEDAR researchers. We
expect this to even include one or more demonstrations of access to
radar data in real time.
<p>
Here is how it will be set up: The room will contain five PCs with
web access and a viewgraph machine. The purpose of the latter is
to allow the presenters to give overviews of their demonstrations
and to describe their data, perhaps in some detail if necessary.
<p>
All the demonstrations will not use viewgraphs. In fact there are
no specific requirements for what a demonstration must do, but here
are a few things that we expect to happen:<br>
<ol>
<li>Demonstration of how to access the institution's data in the
   CEDAR database<br>

<li>The same type of demonstration for databases at the presenter's
   institution<br>

<li>Demonstrations of access to real- or near real- time data allowing
   multi-facility cooperation during experiments.<br>
</ol><p>
The presenters in the agenda below will have access to as many of the
PCs as they need during their time, because some presentations will
consist of multiple demonstrations. Attendees should feel free to try
out what they have learned on free computers.  We expect the breaks to
be used for less formal demonstrations and additional experimentation.
The person listed in the agenda will not necessarily be the only member
of the institution present and taking part, but would be able to field
questions about the demonstration ahead of time.
<p>
There is room on the schedule for some additional demonstrations.
