The topside ionosphere is the region above the F region peak where the
abundance of light ions (i.e. hydrogen, and helium) becomes
significant. This region couples the O+ dominated F-region to the
plasmasphere which is mostly composed of protons. In many studies of
this region one or more ISR radars, spacecraft measurements, ground
based optical instruments may be used together and complemented with
numerical simulations in order to try to understand the
ionosphere-plasmasphere system which is embedded in the
thermosphere-exosphere gas. More information can be found at the
POLITE homepage:

The workshop is intended to provide a forum to present recent progress
and discuss future directions. It will follow up some of issues raised
at the 2000 topside workshop held at Arecibo earlier this year

In addition we hope to start
planning our next workshop. As usual we will do our best to maintain
formal presentations to the bare minimum and leave ample time for
informal discussions. Some of the presentations we expect include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Mike Sulzer on the progress of Jicamarca topside datataking efforts<br>
<li>Scott Bailey on measurements of higher levels of solar XUV<br>
<li>Stan Solomon brief presentation  related to the GLOW model<br>
</ul>
