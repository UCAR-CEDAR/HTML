<h1>2000 CEDAR Poster Guidelines</h1>
</center>
<p>
<font size=+1.0> 
Authors are encouraged to present <i>new results</i> and to <i>emphasize
their relevance</i> to the CEDAR program as they formulate their poster
presentations. Posters should be self-explanatory at first encounter. That
is, any viewer should be able to understand the investigation/report even
in the absense of a verbal presentation.<p>

Posters should be neat, be arranged logically, be legible from 2 feet, and fit
<b>within</b> a 4x4-ft. space.  They should include a title that is legible
from 6 feet away, a short summary of objectives, and a list of conclusions.
Informative figures/diagrams should be of appropriate size so as to be
legible.<p>
