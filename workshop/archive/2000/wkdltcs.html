LTCS is an ongoing CEDAR working group that focuses on the mesosphere and
lower thermosphere, encouraging coordinated collaborative investigations 
using a combination of observations and modeling efforts.   The goal
is a better understanding of the dynamic and electrodynamic processes
coupling the lower and upper atmosphere.  The objectives of this
year's workshop will be 
<br>
	- to update the group on the progress of collaborative research
topics (see below),
<br>
	- to hear about new opportunities and progress from researchers
working on other LTCS-related activities,
<br>
	- to inform the group of proposed TIMED-CEDAR research efforts,
and plan for upcoming LTCS-related collaborative TIMED-CEDAR studies.  
<br>
Working Groups:
<br>
1.  TIMED-CEDAR collaborative studies - Coordinator: D. Drob
	Other participants: Fejer, Forbes, Palo, Buonsanto
<br>
2.  Geomagnetic Activity - Coordinator: I. Azeem
	Other participants: Johnson, Nozawa, Goncharenko, Salah, Clark,
	Kivanc, Venkatraman, Fesen
<br>
3.  Climatology - Coordinator: C. Fesen
	Other participants: Avery, Manson, Kivanc, Venkatraman, 
	Goncharenko, Salah, Williams, Clark, Azeem, Johnson, Nozawa,
	Deutsch, Balthazar, Fesen
