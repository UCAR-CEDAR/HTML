The CEDAR WLS working group is concerned with the scheduling, execution, and 
analysis of coordinated experiments directed towards obtaining comprehensive, 
global datasets which detail the upper atmospheric signatures and consequences 
of magnetospheric substorms. Coordinated incoherent scatter radar experiments, 
using the World Day program, have formed the core of the WLS data taking 
operations and these experiments have been incorporated into the Space Weather 
Month (Sept. 1998) and SPARC collaboratory multi-instrument/participant 
campaigns.
Real-time monitors of disturbance/substorm conditions

and shared datasets have been employed
to permit real-time analysis (e.g. SPARC) and experiment modification. 
Observation intervals have included a number of major storms September 25 1998

The CEDAR 2000 WLS workshop will combine a review of phenomena observed during 
the Sept. 1999 Space Weather month, as well as current status of projects 
arising from WLS campaign operations. A WLS WWW page summarizes preliminary 
radar/ground-based observations made during the Wide-Latitude Substorm Study - 
September 15-17, 1999

During the
workshop, Arecibo and Jicamarca observations related to the expansion of the 
equatorial anomaly to higher latitudes, and related effects will be presented. 
Millstone Hill observations of the effects of polarization-jet electric fields 
at sub-auroral latitude will be discussed.
