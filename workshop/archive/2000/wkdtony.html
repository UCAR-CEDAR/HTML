<p>
Under the auspices of the URSI Incoherent Scatter Working Group (ISWG),
about 21 days of co-ordinated observations are scheduled each year on the
World's incoherent scatter facilities.  The facilities include Jicamarca,
Arecibo, Kyoto, Irkutsk, Karkov, Millstone Hill, Tromso, Sondrestromfjord,
and Svalbard. The observations run for at least thirty hours, but may be
extended for up to about six days in special cases.  The experiments to be
run are selected during the previous year and preference is given to
proposals which can exploit data from as many of the radars as possible.
<p>
Proposals can be submitted to the Chairman of the URSI ISWG
(Tony.van.Eyken@eiscat.com at present) at any time but the draft schedule
for the following year is largely determined during the Planning Workshop
held during the CEDAR meeting in June each year.
<p>
Proposals should contain a suggested experiment name, contact person, time
of year, number of hours required, and a short statement of the goals and
expected returns (suitable for inclusion as a footnote to the 2001
schedule). The present draft proposal is always available at
<a href="http://www.eiscat.uit.no/URSI/">
http://www.eiscat.uit.no/URSI/</a>. Other supporting arguments can also be
submitted, but the best plan is to attend the Planning Workshop and argue
the case yourself.
<p>
If you wish to influence the structure of the 2001 incoherent scatter
program, you should plan to attend the Planning Workshop.  Since it is the
very last workshop of the 2000 CEDAR meeting, we will try to complete the
business quickly and draft copies of the 2001 schedule will be available
from about the middle of the CEDAR meeting to try and ensure this.
