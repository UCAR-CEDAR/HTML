This joint CEDAR and GEM
working group session will share descriptions of ongoing VxO efforts 
and continue ongoing community discussions of the instrument suites 
needed for solving some of the long standing 
solar-heliosphere-magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling 
problems. What strategy should the DASI community follow: global 
array of inexpensive instruments or regional array of high-dollar 
comprehensive systems. What instruments are crucial?
