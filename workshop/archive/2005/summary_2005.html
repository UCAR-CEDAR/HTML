<a name="SUM"><h3>Summary of the 2005 Joint CEDAR-GEM Workshop</h3></a>

<p>
The CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions)
Workshop for 2005 was held at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico
in cooperation with the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling) Workshop
at the La Fonda Hotel.  We celebrated the combined meeting with
joint scientific sessions, social events, and a commemorative T-shirt.
The higher level of energy was very beneficial, so we would like to have
joint meetings about once every 5 years in the future.
<p>
A total of 313 CEDAR registrants joined 229 GEM registrants for a grand
total of 542 participants from 94 institutions, 24 outside the United
States and Puerto Rico.
There were 62 universities, 25 labs, and 7 small businesses, with
17 universities and 13 laboratories shared between the two communities.
The 130 CEDAR students and post-docs combined
with 61 GEM students for scientific and social events.  There were also
23 undergraduate students, all of them in the CEDAR community.  GEM hosted
one student from France, while CEDAR hosted 17 students from outside the
United States, including Canada (3), Japan (3), Taiwan (3), Brazil (3),
Peru (2), the United Kingdom (2) and Norway (1).  The number of CEDAR
participants was about the same as last year, with a few more students.
<p>
The Student Workshop on Sunday at La Fonda was organized by the new CEDAR student
representative Carlos Martinis of Boston University in cooperation with Jichun Zhang,
the GEM student representative form the University of Michigan.  There was a joint
session on Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the morning with a tutorial
by Robert McPherron of UCLA looking from the magnetosphere perspective,
and another tutorial by Rod Heelis of the University of Texas at Dallas
from the ionospheric side.  After the student lunch, the theme was
continued for the CEDAR students with four more speakers, while the GEM
students went into a closed session to prepare their students for
the other GEM campaigns of Inner Magnetosphere/Storms and Global Interactions.
The talks are available in .pdf form from:

The students also enjoyed a Bar-B-Q with our NSF representatives on Monday
night at Fort Marcy Suites where most of the CEDAR students were lodged.
Carlos will continue next year in his second year as student representative,
joined by Michael Nicolls of Cornell University.
<p>
Aside from the Student Workshop on Sunday, we had four joint plenary sessions, and
six joint workshop sessions between Monday and Friday, although all sessions
were open to any from both communities.  We also shared a joint poster session
on Wednesday.  During the joint plenary sessions, we had historical talks about
CEDAR and GEM from Tim Killeen of NCAR and Chris Russell of UCLA, respectively.
There were three longer tutorials by Bob Spiro of Rice University on sub-auroral
electric fields, Janet Kozyra of the University of Michigan talked about mass and energy
flows in superstorms, and auroral boundaries was the topic of Gang Lu of HAO/NCAR.
There were shorter talks by John Foster of MIT, Vladimir Papitashvili of the
University of Michigan, Mike Wiltberger of HAO/NCAR, and Tomoko Matsuo of IMAGE/NCAR
on distributed instruments, e-science, modeling and data assimilation, respectively.
The CEDAR Prize Lecture was given by James Hecht of The Aerospace Corporation
on 'The Turbulent Oxygen Mixing Experiment (TOMEX) and Instabilities in the
Mesopause Region'.  The sole CEDAR tutorial was given by Edward Llewellyn of the
University of Saskatchewan on 'Atmospheric Tomography:  The Odin/OSIRIS Experience'.

Including the joint workshops, there were 28 workshops, which was 3 more
than last year.  Final reports for some of the specific workshops are at:

<p>
The 2005 joint meeting continued the trend started in 2004 to use less plenary
time for programmatic talks.  We had
about six programmatic talks during the joint plenary sessions for introductions,
a report on the student workshop, and topics about NSF, IHY/IPY/eGY and AMISR.
CEDAR had additional talks to announce the student poster prize winners,
present the Passive Optics Report, update the CEDAR Database, discuss
the NASA Roadmap, and give a couple of announcements.  The total was about
two and a half hours of programmatic talks, or about half of the time spent
for programmatic talks in 2004.
<p>
Additional plenary talks were six CEDAR and related post-doc reports given by
Rebecca Bishop of Clemson, Weilin Pan of SRI,
Lars Dyrud of Boston University, Lara Waldrop of the University of Illinois,
Tao Yuan of Colorado State University,
and Josef Drexler of Cornell.
<p>
We enjoyed three poster sessions, one on Monday late afternoon for
CEDAR mesosphere-lower-thermosphere (MLT) topics with 52 posters in the
Eldorado Pavilion,
a joint session from 4-9 PM on Tuesday with 74 'CEDAR' and 64 'GEM' posters,
and a GEM session on Thursday evening with 48 posters at La Fonda.
Abstract handouts were available for each session. There were 238 posters
total, 126 'CEDAR' and 112 'GEM', with 134 student posters.
83% of the GEM students had a poster and 37% of the non-students,
while 44% of the undergrad CEDAR students, 69% of the non-undergrad,
and 23% of the non-student population of CEDAR participated.
There was a record number of 84 CEDAR student posters, which broke the
previous record of 78 student posters last year.  61 of these posters
were judged in the student competition.
<p>
There were four student winners and two honorable mentions in the poster competition.
The two winners from the MLT poster session were Jonathan Snively from the
Pennsylvania State University and Ruben Delgado from the University
of Puerto Rico, with an honorable mention for Erin Lay of the University of
Washington.  The two winners from the joint poster session with GEM were
Fabiano Rodrigues of Cornell University and Marco Milla from the University
of Illinois.  Another honorable mention went to Pedrina Morais Terra dos Santos
who recently graduated from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE)
in Brazil. The winners received autographed copies of the paperback book
'Ionospheres' by Robert Schunk and Andrew Nagy and achievement certificates,
which will also go to the honorable mentions.
The GEM students were not involved in the poster competition.
<p>
Santa Fe Destinations arranged most of the extra-curricular activities
<a href="/workshop/archive/2005/SFD_trips_2005.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
(.pdf)</a>
for the 2005 joint CEDAR-GEM Workshop.
We took a 48-passenger bus from Fort Collins, Colorado to Santa Fe with
7 CEDAR and 6 GEM students coming down from Colorado.  This bus was then used to
take students to the student bowling social at Silva Lanes on Sunday
evening and to go back and forth between Fort Marcy Suites and the Eldorado
and La Fonda hotels.
Santa Fe Destinations offered
<a href="/workshop/archive/2005/SFD_trips_2005.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
extra fee</a>
classes and tours of Tsankawi Indian ruins,
Museum Hill, Tent Rocks, Bandelier/Bradbury and Chimayo Village.  We also
took the bus for a shopping expedition at Tin-Nee-Ann's Trading Company.
<p>
The 2006 CEDAR Workshop will take place at the Eldorado Hotel
in Santa Fe, New Mexico June 19-23.  Due to scheduling conflicts at
the Eldorado, this is an unusual 4-day workshop from Tuesday through
Friday, with the Student Workshop on Monday.  The 2006 GEM Workshop
will be held in Snowmass, Colorado June 26-30.
