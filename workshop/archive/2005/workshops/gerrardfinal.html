Like last year's workshop devoted to the same topic(s), this workshop allowed for both invited and contributing
presenters to informally discuss atmospheric data assimilation techniques and their use in subsequent
forecasting endeavors.  Unlike last year's workshop, we primarily focused on issues/phenomena associated 
with the middle atmosphere, leaving upper atmospheric data assimilation and forecasting issues to be 
addressed in other workshop sessions at the joint GEM-CEDAR 2005 meeting.  The overall goals of this 
workshop were to 1) continue to raise awareness of the importance and application of such data assimilation
and forecasting research in the stratospheric and mesospheric regions, 2) allow for an informal setting
for both students and new researchers to participate, and 3) allow for a unique forum that such topics could 
be discussed within the CEDAR community, much like similar workshops held by the SPARC and IUGG 
communities.  
<p>
The 10:30 AM Friday morning workshop was well attended and three core presentations were given by:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="C5_Matsuo_presentation.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Tomoko Matsuo</a>,
	Ensemble Filtering using a Middle Atmosphere Model
<li>
<a href="C5_Liu_presentation.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Han-Li Liu</a>,
	Sensitivity of WACCM and Implications for Predictability
<li>
<a href="C5_Gerrard_presentation.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Andrew Gerrard</a>,
	Gravity Wave Propagation from the Ground to the Thermosphere: Initial Results from the FOREGRATS Model
</ul>
<p>
The workshop ran over it's allotted time slot due to the active and lively discussions of both the presenters 
and the attendees.  Specifically, numerous participants raised interesting issues and/or made informal, short 
presentations on related subjects (e.g., Rich Collins discussed the upcoming IPY and role of forecasting, 
Jan Sojka discussed the timescales involved in middle atmospheric predictability).  Furthermore, small 
group discussions ran well into Friday afternoon.
<p>
Each core presentation had it own specific scientific conclusions which can be identified from the
presenter's slides available online. Larger issues facing the community, which were also actively discussed
during the workshop, included such topics as:
<ol>
<li>The role of the CEDAR community in progressing the state-of-the-art in middle atmospheric data
assimilation and forecasting.  Specifically, given that CEDAR members are largely experimentalists
or theoreticians, is there enough internal support for such research?  Might it be better to
address these issues from within other organizations [such as those mentioned above]?

<li>What is the source of funding for such middle atmospheric work?  NSF is largely divided between
upper and lower atmospheres, with neither specifically claiming the middle atmosphere as a realm.  
Given that an understanding of the "weather" of the middle atmosphere is believed to be crucial in 
many upper and lower processes, how/to whom should proposals be submitted to or funded by?

<li>There is a lengthy and ongoing argument of whether "forecasting" should be considered a
"science" or an "art form."  This topic has a large number of implications and repercussions.  For
example, some scientific journals do not accept forecasting papers.  So how do the members of the 
middle atmospheric forecasting community advance the field?
</ol>
These, and a host of other issues, have no clear and immediate answer.  As such, they are raised herein as 
future discussion points.

Those interested in other material from the workshop or who wish to express an opinion on the three
sample community issues are encouraged to email A. Gerrard (agerrar@clemson.edu).
