TIMED science program included ground-based observation from the on-set 
through TIMED/CEDAR and NASA/NSF collaboration with the expectation of 
great science enabled via synergy between ground-based and space-borne 
observations, and model simulation. With TIMED four instruments observing 
for more than four years, and many improved ground-based CEDAR instrument 
observing correlatively, many interesting and unexpected science results 
were made possible because of the synergism between ground-based and TIMED 
observation.   The existing ground-based and past satellite data sets also 
allow more close examination of long-term observations in the mesosphere 
and lower thermosphere (MLT) region by combining current data sets with 
past observations.    The purpose of this workshop is to bring together 
recent highlights of the collaborated research as well as to discuss more 
creative synergistic collaborations and long-term MLT studies in the 
future.
