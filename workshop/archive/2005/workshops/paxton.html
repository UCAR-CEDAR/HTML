The current solar cycle has provided new opportunities to examine the
coupled geospace system as it responds to a variety of drivers.  Since the
launch of the TIMED satellite in late 2001, geospace has been rocked by
powerful high speed streams in 2003, four different superstorm events in
2003 and 2004, a variety of magnetic storms, high dynamic pressure hits,
and intervals of repeated long-duration flare events, the latest in 
January 2005,  which also produced several post-ejecta regions of 
extremely low density solar wind.  The solar wind void intervals permitted 
intense up to 10 keV polar rain to enter the polar cap creating strong 
interhemispheric asymmetries in the ITM system during a magnetically 
active interval. Evidence is accumulating that:
<ol>
<li> the MLTI response
depends on the order of solar and solar wind drivers through 
preconditioning effects
<li> coupling between geospace regions is
important in determining even features as fundamental as the polar cap 
potential
<li> disturbances to atmospheric chemistry may be prolonged
through interactions with dynamical features in the atmosphere
<li>extreme events may modify signatures of ion-neutral coupling
</ol>
<p>
At the same time, a distributed fleet of operating satellite missions
Worldwide are viewing elements of the system from sun to Earth. 
Ground-based observations are becoming more integrative, providing global 
rather than regional views of the system.  New efforts at integrating 
ground-based observations, through global maps and data assimilation are 
being pursued as part of the CAWSES program, the ICESTAR program  and in 
preparation for the International Heliophysical Year 2007.  This workshop 
seeks to find new ways of integrating observations from satellites, and 
ground-based facilities, assimilative models and large-scale simulations 
to explore the ionosphere and atmosphere as active elements in the 
geospace system.
