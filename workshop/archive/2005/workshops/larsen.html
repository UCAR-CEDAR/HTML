The EQUIS 2 sounding rocket campaign was carried out at Kwajalein atoll
in the central Pacific in August and September 2004.  The campaign
represents the first new sounding rocket measurements in the equatorial
region in over a decade.  The campaign provided new measurements of
both E-region and lower F region electrodynamics and plasma
irregularities.  In addition to the in situ measurements, the campaign
provided an extensive incoherent scatter radar data set obtained with
the dual-frequency, fully-steerable ALTAIR radar which operated on
approximately half the nights during the campaign period.  The workshop
will focus on results from the campaign, as well as related results
dealing with equatorial dynamics.
