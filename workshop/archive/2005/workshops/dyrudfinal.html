The workshop was held in a short presentation style followed by  
discussions. We had 11 presentations in the 2 hrs long session, 5 of  
which where student presentations. The speakers were Lars Dyrud from  
Center for Remote Sensing; Meers Openheim and Yacob Dimant from  
Boston University; Elias Lau and Santiago de la Peña from University  
of Colorado; Anne Smith from NCAR, David Fritts and Diego Janches  
from CoRA/NWRA; and Stan Briscinski, Akshay Malhotra and Arnab Roy  
from Penn State University.  The speakers and the topics discussed  
reflected the multi-disciplinary nature of this field.  Topics  
included the meteor deposition of  metal layers, modeling of meteor  
trail and head echoes, modeling of the global meteoric mass flux,  
observation using ISR radars and satellites and a novel meteor radar  
for momentum flux measurements. All these subjects showed once again  
the growing interest by the community in the effects  and  
understanding of meteors and the mesopause.  Finally, the convenors,  
Diego Janches and Lars Dyrud would like to thank everyone that took  
part and attended this years workshop.
