The coordination of ground-based and satellite observations under the
TIMED/CEDAR program has provided unprecedented coverage of the Mesosphere
and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region. The ground-based instruments provide
measurements of MLT winds and temperatures at specific geographic 
locations
over many local times and complement the TIMED instruments, which provides
similar measurements globally at one or two local times on any given day. 
These two data sets can be combined to obtain the true mean fields and a
higher-time-resolution picture of atmospheric waves, especially tides. 
Additionally, over the last few years, different techniques have been
developed to address the aliasing in measurements obtained by spaceborne
instruments. It is the focus of this workshop to coordinate datasets to
study the zonal mean, tides, and planetary waves and causes of their
short-term variabilities and foster collaboration between satellite and
groundbased teams to identitfy techniques for combining datasets and
overcoming aliasing.  We encourage people to present specific observations
and scientific topics that can be examined through multiple datasets.
