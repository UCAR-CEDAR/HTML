Over the last few years, several studies have documented mesospheric 
response to sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events. Mesospheric cooling 
has been observed to precede peak SSW events, and there is evidence of 
feedback coupling between the stratosphere and mesosphere. Many aspects of 
the dynamical and chemical state of the mesosphere during these events are 
still relatively unknown. In this workshop we intend to bring together our 
current understanding of the effects of sudden stratospheric warming on 
the mesospheric dynamics and thermal structure. This workshop is expected 
to provide an opportunity for modelers and experimentalist to bring 
together their results related to mesospheric manifestation of sudden 
stratospheric warming events. The workshop will provide on open forum for 
participants to get together, discuss their data, models results, and plan 
their collaborative research. If you wish to present your research, please 
contact one of the conveners with a title and a short abstract.
