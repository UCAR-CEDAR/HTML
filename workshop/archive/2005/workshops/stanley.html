This workshop will focus on recent experimental and theoretical
advances in the understanding of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs),
sprites, and other unusual atmospheric discharge phenomena which
influence the stratosphere, mesosphere, and beyond.
<p>
Sprites are spectacular luminous glows which occupy volumes in excess
of thousands of cubic kilometers in clear air above thunderstorms in
the altitude range ~40-90 km.  Sprites often exhibit an amorphous non
structured glow at their tops, which gradually converts to highly
(predominantly vertically) structured breakdown regions at lower
altitudes.  Sprites are transient in nature and last only a small
fraction of a second following intense positive or negative lightning
discharges (more than 90% of sprites are associated with positive
lightning discharges).  Observations from ground and from space
indicate that sprites occur over most regions of the globe (in
temperate and tropical areas, over the oceans, and over the land).
<p>
Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) have been observed by the RHESSI
satellite with photon energies exceeding 20 MeV.  Recent evidence
indicates a strong relationship between TGFs and a certain type of
lightning discharge.  The gamma rays are almost certainly the result
of bremsstrahlung from a high energy electron beam.  Unlike sprites,
TGFs are focused mainly in the tropics and readily occur during
daylight.  It has been widely assumed that TGFs occur at high altitude
(overlapping with sprites) in order to produce an observable gamma-ray
flux in orbit, though recent data is challenging this assumption.
<p>
This year's workshop will discuss plans for the summer 2005 campaigns
in the USA and elsewhere as well as coordinated observations with
RHESSI (TGFs) and FORMOSAT 2 (sprites).  New modeling and theoretical
studies will also be presented.
