Background:  Maui-MALT is a well-established research program funded jointly by the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) and the Air Force Office Scientific Research (AFOSR).  Its primary goal is to investigate 
the dynamics of the middle atmosphere at low/equatorial latitudes in unprecedented detail.    The program 
capitalizes on the high quality observing conditions and the excellent facilities available at the USAF AMOS 
facility located at the 10,000 ft summit of Haleakala Crater, Maui, Hawaii.
<p>
Coordinated measurements using a cluster of passive optical and meteor radar instruments were initiated in 
2002.  The basic mode of operation to date has comprised several focused campaigns (using the lidar facility)
for detailed dynamical studies imbedded in 4-year long time series of passive optical and meteor radar
measurements.  Current instrumentation includes an Na wind/temperature lidar (U of I) utilizing the AMOS 
3.7 m telescope, an OH/O2 band temperature mapper (USU), an all-sky OH imager and an OH/O2 band 
zenith photometer (U of I), a multi-channel airglow imager and a narrow field 630 nm `spread F' imager 
(Cornell U), a fast IR OH imager (Aerospace Corp), and a meteor radar (U of I).   
<p>
Maui-MALT has achieved great success quantifying the low-latitude MLT region, however, we have now 
reached a stage where new operating scenarios need to be considered due to recent cost increases.  The 
workshop will therefore focus initially on an overview of the program followed by several short presentations
highlighting new results (as part of a Special issue of JGR).  The second half of the workshop will be
an "open forum" discussion on plans for future operations in Hawaii, possibly from other sites and an
introduction to the new Maui-MALT Enterprise lidar developments.
