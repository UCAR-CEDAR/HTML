The response of the high-latitude thermosphere/ionosphere system to
Joule heating and Lorentz forcing continues to be a topic of
considerable interest.  Topics for investigation include our ability to
specify the forcing accurately due to the scale-size dependence of the
Lorentz forcing and especially the Joule heating.  The response of the
neutral atmosphere to such forcing is also being shown to be more
subtle than had previously been appreciated.  For example, there is
evidence for a strong response in the upper E region even in relatively
quiet conditions in the vicinity of stable arcs.  In the lower E
region, the effects of moderate forcing can sometimes have more impact
on the neutral atmosphere than the effects of stronger forcing simply
because the height range where the strongest response occurs moves up
or down as the strength of the forcing changes.  Three recent
experiments that have addressed these topics include the HEX, CODA, and
JOULE experiments that were carried out at Poker Flat, Alaska.  The
goal of the workshop is to address issues related to the specification
of the local forcing and thermosphere/ionosphere response in the
context of those experiments, although any contributions that address
these topics are appropriate for inclusion in the workshop.
