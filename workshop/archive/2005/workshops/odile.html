    This workshop will address the challenges in forecasting the equatorial
    ionosphere and irregularities within.  The discussions will be related
    but not limited to the C/NOFS (Communication and Navigation Outage
    Forecast System) mission.
<p>
    C/NOFS is a satellite mission dedicated to forecasting ionospheric
    densities, irregularities and scintillation.  It will be launched in
    2005, in a 13 degrees inclination, 710 x 375 km orbit.  Its instruments
    will provide plasma parameters, electric & magnetic fields (AC and DC),
    density fluctuations, and neutral wind.  It will also have a GPS
    receiver, and an RF beacon.  Ground-based instruments and models, and
    space weather products are an integral part of the mission.
<p>
    The purpose of this workshop is to:
<ol>
<li>    Address the main difficulties in forecasting the equatorial
ionospheric behaviors 
<li>    Define collaborative projects that involve ground and space
measurements
<li>    Report on CNOFS validation plans and accomplishments
</ol>
