The Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Campaign WG 1 on plasma outflow co-sponsored with CEDAR  a tutorial 
by Dr. Gang Lu, HAO/NCAR, entitled, "Auroral boundaries: finding them in data and models"
(Wednesday 0800-0850 AM)
and a joint GEM/CEDAR workshop on the same topic (Wednesday 29 June 0130-0330 PM).

set the tone for a joint GEM/CEDAR workshop that
followed.  She discussed the physics associated with boundary formation and reviewed the work that has 
been done to use in-situ plasma observations, high frequency and incoherent scatter radar observations to 
elicit boundary locations.  She also discussed techniques used to identify boundaries in MHD code outputs 
and gave a brief introduction to the enhanced boundary finding abilities of the new AMISER radar.

The lively joint GEM/CEDAR session had 11 speakers and quite a bit of discussion.  Mervin Freeman 
(British Antarctic Survey) discussed  the spectral width features in the SuperDarn radar that can be used 
boundary identifications.  He showed that, except between 02 and 06 LT the agreement between boundaries 
identified by SuperDarn and DMSP plasma agree well. Josh Semeter (BU) discussed various representations 
of the polar cap boundary over Sondrestrom, Greenland, using IMAGE, FAST, ISR, and spectral imagery.  
In particular, comparisons between sheared plasma flow in the ionosphere and optical auroral boundaries 
agree very well.
<p>
Dan Weimer (Mission Research Corp) showed pathological examples of open and closed boundaries with 
structure to illustrate that automatic boundary identification is a very challenging task indeed.  Bob 
Strangeway (UCLA) made the same point using data from the FAST satellite.
<p>
Michelle Thomsen (LANL) noted that the success that Kp has in organizing magnetospheric phenomena 
follows from the locations of the magnetometer stations used to construct Kp being at latitudes near the 
auroral boundary where they are very sensitive to changes in the convection electric field which drives 
magnetopsheric processes.   Karen Remick (USGS) made the same point but with the very extensive set of
magnetometer data she has accumulated.  
<p>
Joe Borovsky (LANL) made two major points, one unintended.  First: he showed comparisons of all sky 
camera images at/near the magnetic foot points of geosynchronous satellites. Comparisons of plasma 
observed at geosynchronous altitude and auroral arcs showed that the diffuse aurora is associated with the 
displacement of the ion and electron plasma sheets.  He unintended point was that the chairperson was so 
used to electronic projection, that old-fashioned view graphs were difficult to accommodate!
<p>
Erika Harnett (U of Washington) presented multi-stream MHD results demonstrating change in auroral 
boundary, field aligned currents, and outflow with increasing southward IMF - currents enhance and move 
to nightside. H+ outflow increases in area while O+ outflow increases particularly more on the dayside. Lutz 
Rastaetter (CCMS/GSFC) presented a polar cap metric study for Feb. 18, 1999 event using the  BATSRUS, 
Weimer-2K and OpenGGCM.  The results showed substantial deviation of all models from data.  He noted 
that field line tracing produced better results than using field-aligned currents.
<p>
Thomas Sotirelis (JHU/APL) showed examples of nightside boundary identifications using automated 
procedures on DMSP plasma data.  He noted that the interval selected by the conveners did not have 
believable boundaries until instrumental degradation was accounted for.   He noted that there are limits to  
correlations involving Dst and the stretching index because of  relatively long magnetopsheric response 
times
<p>
Bill Peterson (CU/LASP) argued that dynamic coordinates derived from plasma data provide better ordering 
that geomagnetic coordinates of invariant latitude and magnetic local time, but that their definition is 
instrument and platform dependant.
