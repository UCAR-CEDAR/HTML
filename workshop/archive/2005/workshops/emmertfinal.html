Neutral winds are an important component of the coupled ionosphere-thermosphere system, and affect the 
distribution of ionospheric plasma via numerous processes. Experimental and theoretical studies often 
require accurate estimates of neutral dynamics, but concurrent wind data are generally sparse or not
available. In these cases, empirical assimilations of past winds measurement can be used to predict large-scale
wind patterns for given geophysical conditions. 
<p>
Currently, the only global empirical model of thermospheric neutral winds is the Horizontal Wind Model 
(HWM), which was last updated in 1993. Development of an upgraded empirical model is underway, and 
the current focus is on improving the performance of HWM in the E and F regions, particularly during
geomagnetically disturbed conditions. In this workshop, we discussed large-scale thermospheric
wind behavior, the impact of winds on ionospheric properties, and ways to improve empirical wind specification.
<p>
Our goal was to get CEDAR community involved in contributing and developing timely strategies for the 
HWM upgrade.  We solicited contributions related to climatological wind results in the E and F regions as 
they relate to important aspects of winds in ionospheric studies. We were particularly interested in supporting
numerical simulations (especially multi-year studies and investigations of systematic storm effects),
which can benefit from and contribute to empirical studies.  Thirty three scientists attended the workshop 
including the speakers and conveners.  Of those thirty three about half were students.  The two-hour
workshop consisted of eight short presentations followed by about 45 minutes of
open discussion and debate.
<p>
Douglas Drob (US Naval Research Laboratory) began the workshop session with a review of the HWM
statistical data analysis and assimilation codes, overview of new upper atmospheric wind data sets, and model
upgrade strategy.
<p>
Geoff Crowley (South West Research Institute) discussed the need for a
rigorous data based validations of winds in current TIEGCMs, as well as the utility
of updating the current HWM empirical wind model for the purposes of specifying neutral atmospheric 
inputs in first-principles ionospheric models which lack a theoretical neutral atmosphere.
In both instances there is a need to understand the geophysical drivers of the neutral
thermospheric and ionospheric climatology.  In addition, just as statistical and empirical data analysis can
provide valuable insight in to current theoretical thermospheric and ionospheric modeling efforts, TIEGCM
modeling efforts can provide valuable information for the development of improved mathematical
representations for empirical models, especially
synthetic data sets for the development of empirical data assimilation
procedures.  A series of multi-year TIEGCM runs will be generated to develop
and test a new HWM model formulation.

Larisa Goncharenko (Haystack Observatory) presented new data and a climatology of lower thermospheric
winds over Millstone Hill.   In general, current empirical and tabular climatologies
under-estimate the magnitude of the winds over Millstone Hill, but there is relatively consistent agreement with
seasonal and tidal phases.    In addition, good agreement is seen between the
Millstone Hill wind observations and observations made by the NASA-UARS WINDII instrument.
The new ISR data set shows differences from earlier Millstone Hill climatologies,
including larger wind magnitudes, greater differences between equinoxes, and the occurrence of a distinct 
westward wind in summer morning.  Planning for a continuous 30-day data collection campaign, to
be conducted in September 2005, was discussed. 
<p>
Michael Faivre (Clemson University) presented results
from the Arequipa, Peru FPI.  This instrument was recently outfitted with a
new CCD camera that improved instrument sensitivity.  Data processing
techniques for estimating the line-of-site wind velocities and temperatures from the circular fringe pattern on 
the new CCD were presented.  This was followed by a presentation of line-of-site wind measurements.  The relationship between measured
temperatures and wind, as well as divergence and convergence quantities were
in the context of the midnight temperature maximum phenomena, other low latitude temperature
enhancements, and the terdiurnal tidal oscillation.
<p>
Next, Geonhwa Jee (Utah State University) presented results of a theoretical study of the
sensitivity of total electron content (TEC) to neutral winds.  It was demonstrated that the neutral wind has a 
significant effect on the mid-latitude ionospheric plasma density both during the day and night.
Without meridional neutral winds there would be a factor of 2 increase of TEC during the daytime,
and a factor of 4 decrease of TEC during the nighttime, thus highlighting the importance on meridional
neutral winds on the maintenance of the mid-latitude nighttime ionosphere.   The effect of the zonal wind 
showed a strong dependence on the magnetic declination angle, and consequently on geographic longitude.  
<p>
Joe Huba (US Naval Research Laboratory) similarly
discussed the influence of wind specifications on modeled ionospheric plasma density profiles.  The impact 
of different neutral wind specifications on calculations of the low- to mid-latitude ionosphere calculated by 
the SAMI2 model was shown.  Changes in the neutral wind specification can significantly modify the calculated
width and symmetry of the ionization crests.  A neutral wind/ionosphere coupling mechanism was
offered to explain observed `brightness waves' associated with the midnight temperature maximum.
Model calculations with SAMI2 and TIEGCM using HWM specified winds were unable reproduce or 
explain the observed phenomena, whereas calculations using the SLIM model (Anderson) in conjunction
with SAMI2 showed consistency with the observations.
<p>
Bela Fejer (Utah State University) discussed low-latitude
winds and electric fields.  The coupling of quiet-time thermospheric wind to the electric
field varies significantly with latitude, season, and solar flux.  Geomagnetic storm
generated perturbation winds are more closely coupled to plasma drifts than
is the case during quiet conditions.   Comparison of thermosphic winds
and plasma drift provides important information on ionospheric conductivities, which are otherwise difficult 
to measure directly.
<p>
John Emmert (George Mason University) high-lighted
quiet and disturbed wind features seen in recent ground-based and satellite wind measurements that
are potentially worth including in the new HWM.  These included reformulation and
specification of the global disturbance wind patterns, including clear seasonal and solar activity dependence.   In
addition, the new data indicates greater solar cycle dependence, including coupled seasonal effects during 
geomagnetically quiet conditions.  Additional equinoctial asymmetries in the high-latitude wind
patterns were also shown to be of significance.  Finally, the known
organization of high-latitude winds in geomagnetic coordinates was highlighted and supported using
recent high-quality experimental data wind data sets.
<p>
In addition to discussion resulting from the items presented above, several main issues relating to
the development of the next-generation model were clearly recognized as important to the CEDAR-GEM 
community in the open discussion that followed.
The first was the need to continue collecting high-quality wind data in the lower-thermosphere,
particularly over the complete range of possible geophysical conditions, latitudes, longitudes, and
local time. Data in the night-time E-region is desperately needed as the number of techniques to do so is
currently very limited. The second important issue was related to a proper formulation and representation of
low-latitude terdiurnal tidal component, believed to be related to the MTM and other significant ionospheric 
phenomena.  Finally, of great importance to thermospheric modelers, and also to the eventual
evolution of HWM into a full fledged operational data assimilation system that can be utilized in combination
with current first principles models, is the proper specification and provision of the statistical
uncertainty.  Such a specification would estimate the natural geophysical variability beyond the slowly varying
seasonal and tidal fluctuations of the upper atmospheric winds, and would be determined from the residual
noise of the comprehensive data sets after proper estimation and removal of the seasonal, tidal and
other low -order variability represented by the HWM.
