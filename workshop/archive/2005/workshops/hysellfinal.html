This session was convened to bring the community of users surrounding
the low latitude upper atmospheric facilities (Arecibo and Jicamarca)
into contact with the investigators developing the modes and
experiments performed there. Our objective was to familiarize both
groups with the activities of the other to assure that the most
crucial parameters are being measured and that the resulting data are
being fully utilized. The session began with the theme of the data
needs of modelers, shifted to presentations on new experimental
capabilities, and concluded with an introduction to emerging optical
capabilities at the two sites.

Mihail Codrescu stressed the necessity of exospheric temperature,
composition, wind, and plasma number density measurements at low
latitudes for validating general circulation models (GCMs). Mark
Swisdak pointed out that electric field transients are expected to
produce large TEC modifications during storms and that electric field
measurements therefore need to be made with fine temporal resolution,
something at which both facilities excel. Dave Anderson discussed the
latitude dependence of prompt penetration electric fields,
highlighting the importance of chain studies to space weather
research, a theme returned to by Vince Eccles. Meers Oppenheim
presented new numerical simulations of Farley Buneman waves and
instabilities which could be validated using the AMISR-7 system at
Jicamarca.
<p>
A number of new experimental capabilities have arisen at Jicamarca and
Arecibo since the last CEDAR workshop. Jorge Chau presented results of
the first D and E region incoherent scatter experiments performed at
Jicamarca. Marco Milla showed how plasma number densities and drifts
can now be rapidly extracted from Jicamarca differential phase
measurements using a Kalman filter approach. Mike Sulzer reviewed a
number of new capabilities at Arecibo designed to promote
collaborative studies there, including an optimized version of the
MRACF World Day mode. Among these are dual beam velocity measurements
which were analyzed by Nestor Aponte. Esayas Shume likewise reviewed a
new technique for inferring zonal MLT wind profiles in the electrojet
region at Jicamarca. New gyroline observations at Arecibo (Asti Bhatt)
and mesospheric turbulence measurements at Jicamarca (Li Guo) were
also described.
<p>
A number of optical instruments are being deployed or upgraded at the
low latitude facilities. John Meriwether summarized efforts by his
team to install a miniaturized Fabry Perot interferometer at Arecibo.
He also presented results from the upgraded FPI at Arequipa, Peru,
which showed nighttime neutral temperatures in substantial agreement
with plasma temperatures measured simultaneously at Jicamarca. This
instrument will be complemented by the SOFDI instrument to be deployed
at Huancayo for daytime and nighttime thermospheric wind measurements.
<p>
Finally, prospects for new joint campaigns and studies utilizing the
low-latitude facilities were outlined by Sixto Gonzales. A workshop
geared toward planning and coordinating the campaigns is being
scheduled.
