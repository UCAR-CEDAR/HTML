The M-I Coupling and Ionospheric Storms workshop was held on Thursday, 30 June 2005 in the Anasazi North 
Room. About 80 participants attended the workshop. This workshop focused on ionospheric electric fields and global 
ionospheric disturbances during magnetic storms. Prompt penetration electric fields generally last for less than one 
hour because of the shielding effects of the ring current. However, a recent study suggest that they can last for several 
hours. Disturbance winds and neutral composition also play a crucial role in the generation of ionospheric storms. 
The outstanding problems include what causes the long-duration enhancement of the ionospheric electric field, how 
significantly the penetration electric field causes ionospheric disturbances, how the penetration electric field effect 
can be separated from wind dynamo effect, and how the ionospheric electron density disturbances are related to
neutral winds and composition changes. The speakers of the workshop presented the latest observational and simulation
results related to these problems.

Bela Fejer (USU) began the workshop with a presentation of how prompt penetration electric fields vary with latitude.
Temporal variations of penetration electric field patterns at two storm times at different latitudes were derived
from simulations using the Rice Convection Model (RCM), and the simulation results were compared with observations.
It is concluded that ionospheric conductivity changes strongly affect the local time, latitudinal, and longitudinal
variations of the prompt penetration electric fields.

Ray Greenwald (JHU/APL) reported new observations of storm-time ionospheric convective flows obtained with the 
SuperDARN Wallops radar. The Wallops radar was constructed to provide improved geophysical monitoring instrumentation
at GSFC/WFF and to study plasma flows and ionospheric electric fields at mid-latitudes under disturbed
geomagnetic conditions. The radar detected very strong plasma convection flows at midlatitudes in two instances of 
disturbed/storm-time activity within one month. In both cases, the stormtime expansion of the convection cells lasted
a number of hours. The observations indicate that there was no temporary undershielding, but rather a long-term 
reconfiguration of electric fields and plasma convection in the inner magnetosphere.

Chaosong Huang (MIT) presented the observations of penetration electric fields obtained with the Millstone Hill and 
Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars during magnetic storms. It is shown that the interplanetary electric field can
penetrate to the low-latitude ionosphere without obvious attenuation for several hours during the main phase of storms as
long as the IMF remains southward. The observations imply that the polarization electric field cannot be built in the 
ring current when the magnetic activity is strengthening, so the magnetospheric convection electric field can continuously
penetrate to the low-latitude ionosphere without shielding.

Joe Huba (NRL) presented the simulation results of storm-time penetration electric fields and ionospheric disturbances
with a self-consistent coupling of the RCM and SAMI3 codes. Different variations of the polar cap potential
were used in the simulations. It is found that temporal changes in the polar cap potential produce electric fields that 
modify the F region equatorial drift velocities; the velocities increase in the daytime and decrease in the nighttime by 
up to a factor of 2. Total electron content (TEC) in the midlatitude ionosphere is increased by up to 35%, and the 
equatorial fountain effect is enhanced in the post-sunset period.
<p>
Naomi Maruyama (HAO/NCAR) also presented simulation results of storm-time ionospheric electric field using the 
RCM. It is shown that the magnitude of the penetration electric field from simulation depends on the plasma sheet 
conditions and conductivity as input to the RCM boundary conditions. The simulations reproduced the ionospheric 
electric fields and density disturbances during the magnetic storms on 31 March 2001 and 17 April 2002 and were in 
reasonable agreement with observations.

Marlene Colerico (MIT) showed storm-enhanced density (SED) events detected with global GPS network during
magnetic storms. Ionospheric SED is characterized by high TEC values (>50 TEC units) and correlated with plasmaspheric
drainage plume. SED plumes over Northern Europe and American sectors are compared. This may be the first
time that the occurrence of strong SED plumes over European sector was derived. Magnetic conjugacy effects of SED 
formation were analyzed from GPS and multiple satellite data.

Mariangel Fedrizzi (NOAA/SEC) reported the simulation studies of different mechanisms that are responsible for
F-region height changes during geomagnetic storms. Ionosonde observations during the 31 March 2001 storm are
compared with the CTIPe model. CTIPe results are in good agreement with the observations. The contributions of
mechanisms at middle latitudes include thermospheric wind that is dominant during the night and thermal expansion that is
larger in the nightside sector during the first hours after the storm commencement.

Yongliang Zhang (JHU/APL) presented GUVI observations of composition changes and ionospheric behavior during
magnetic storms. It is found that energy input (particle and Joule heating) from the magnetosphere causes significant
O/N2 depletion down to and beyond the magnetic equator. Time delay between the energy input and O/N2
depletion supports the idea of co-rotation. There is a fairly good positive correlation between O/N2 and TEC. This 
provides a way to use GUVI O/N2 to estimate TEC over oceans where no land GPS observations are made.

John Emmert (GMU) presented observations of average storm-induced thermospheric disturbance winds. It is 
shown that the average disturbance winds at equatorial to upper-mid latitudes are mostly westward and equatorward. 
Daytime disturbance winds extend down to at least 110 km and are generally constant with height above 130 km. 
Low- and mid-latitude nighttime zonal disturbance winds are westward, with average peak magnitudes of 15 m/s for 
moderately disturbed conditions to 50 m/s for strongly disturbed conditions.
<p>
Hien Vo (NAIC/Arecibo) reported the observations of the low-latitude ionospheric response to the November 2004
magnetic storm obtained with Arecibo all-sky imager and global GPS network. Two sequences of ionospheric density 
depletion were observed to move northward and westward over Arecibo in response to the large Dst drop. The
incoherent scatter radar data from Millstone Hill and Arecibo can be used to address the low latitude formation of SED.
