The introduction to proposal writing workshop was a panel type
workshop composed of Bob Kerr (NSF Aeronomy), Phil Richards (NASA) 
Pamela Loughmiller (CEDAR post doc Embry Riddle) and Jonathan Makela 
(University of Illinois).  The workshop began with a brief talk by 
Dr. Richards on how NASA reviews and grades proposals, which is

He also included as an example proposal one of his own proposals from 1999 at

After his
presentation, the floor was opened up to allow questions from the 
audience.  The questions ranged from collaborating with foreign 
institutions to fulfilling all of the requirements on the NSF's 
proposal guide.  Dr. Loughmiller shared her recent experience of what 
it was like to apply for and receive the CEDAR post doc and Professor 
Makela was able to present the perspective of an academic just 
entering a university faculty position.  About 75 people attended the 
workshop and the large number of questions asked made it a very 
productive session.
