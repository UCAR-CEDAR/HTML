This joint CEDAR/GEM session on ionosphere/plasmasphere coupling was focused
on storm-time plasma redistribution, heating, and other mass coupling topics.
Several speakers presented their recent results in a relaxed atmosphere,
allowing for plenty of question and answer time between talks and discussion
at the end of the session.  It was felt to be a successful dialogue between the
ionospheric and magnetospheric communities regarding mid-latitude/inner-magnetospheric
mass coupling.
