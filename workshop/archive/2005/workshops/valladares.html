In the HLPS (High-Latitude Plasma Structures) Working Group of the CEDAR Program,
experimentalists, theoreticians, and modelers join their efforts to study various issues of
high-latitude plasma processes, including polar cap auroras, plasma patches, and
traveling convection vortices. Over the past decade, numerous observational campaigns
have been conducted by the group and several special issues of HLPS research progresses
have been published.
<p>
For the 2005 HLPS workshop, we plan to expand the HLPS study into a new 
research area: the plasma structures in the cusp regions. 
This workshop will address recent results on merging, 
coupling, electrodynamics, and the role of the underlying ionosphere of
the cusp region. The cusp can be understood as a region that maps to the
magnetopause. The importance of this region resides in the participation
of some of the cusp field lines in antiparallel merging. The main effect of
the merging process is the generation of convection cells in both polar caps
and the transferring of solar wind energy, momentum and particles into
the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The ionospheric cusp is also a region where
electron and ion precipitation can produce elevated densities. Similarly, the 
prevailing large electric fields are able to increase recombination rates and 
decrease the local density. These two mechanisms working in concert can
generate unique patterns of enhancement and depletions.
Polar cap patches, seen under IMF Bz negative conditions, 
can be produced by the above mentioned mechanisms, 
but also by the transient and sporadic nature of the reconnection process. 
Concurrently, decameter scale-size irregularities are typically observed 
in the ionospheric cusp. The objective of this session is to better understand
the control that the solar wind IMF, the dynamic pressure and magnetic
activity exert on the optical displays of the cusp aurora and on the
occurrence of plasma structuring seen at the cusp and then at subsequent times
convecting throughout the polar cap. Results will be welcome from ground based
and satellite borne imagers, scanning photometers, radars, magnetometers, and 
from modeling/theoretical investigations, on the dynamics, electrodynamics,
and manifestations of cusp coupling processes of the solar
wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system and its conjugacy. The objective is to
to unite the CEDAR and GEM communities in a discussion forum of
the physics of the cusp region.

The workshop will mainly consist of short-presentations. At the
beginning, there will be an introductory talk and at the end,
we will hold an informal round-table discussion to plan future
HLPS campaigns. 
Graduate students are especially encouraged to join this workshop.
