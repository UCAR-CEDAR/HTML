This workshop compares aspects of M/I Coupling on Earth with that of other
planets. Its goal is to bring together the variety of expertise we use to
understand our own space environment and use this to address outstanding
questions related to other planets, and vice-versa. Brief introductions to
comparative magnetospheres and aeronomy (of Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter) will
be provided for context, followed by an open discussion of similarities and
differences between M/I coupling of planetary bodies and Earth. In addition,
we will discuss outstanding questions that we as a community would like to
address.
