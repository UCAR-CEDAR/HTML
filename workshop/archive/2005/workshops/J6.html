Recently, many more data sets in the ionosphere and magnetosphere have
become available.  For example, the question of continuous month long data
sets is becoming the norm rather than the exception.  In the magnetosphere,
the IMAGE satellite provides synoptic pictures of the plasma distribution.
In addition, models of these regions have become much more sophisticated.
There is emerging a need to better couple models with data sets.  This
typically has come in the form of data-model comparisons and validation
efforts.  Other groups have begun creating data-assimilation models.  For
this session, we solicit talks on models that utilize data and data
providers that would like input on what quantities modelers desire.  Talks
on data preparation for ingestion/comparison or forward modeling techniques
are also welcome.  UAF Steering Committee will jointly participate with the
modelers and assimilators for this workshop.
