Accurate calibration is important for comparing observations taken by
different instruments, for model-data comparisons, and for acquiring long-term data
records.  Consistent calibration techniques are critically important when multiple 
observers contribute to a long-term data set and when there are upgrades to the 
instrument(s) acquiring the data set.   This year's optical calibration workshop 
continued discussion of these topics addressed at the 2004 CEDAR optical
calibration workshop.
<p>
The workshop began with an historical perspective by Fred Roesler.  He
described the development of a nebular calibration method used by Wisconsin 
observers for absolute and relative calibration of diffuse terrestrial, planetary, and 
astronomical observations.  Roesler followed with a description of additional
challenges associated with cross-calibration between instruments.
<p>
The Wisconsin observations are compared with the intensity of nebular
sources, all of which are tied to the North American Nebula.  The observations are 
then corrected for differences in atmospheric extinction due to the slant path of the 
sky observation compared with that of the nebular calibration.  The primary nebular
calibration sources used for Wisconsin H-alpha observations were calibrated
using standard stars and corroborated using a blackbody source.  More recently, 
observations of the interstellar medium taken as part of the Southern H-alpha Sky 
Survey Atlas by Gaustad et al. [2001] were compared with those taken by the
Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper Fabry-Perot [Haffner et al., 2003], further corroborating
the calibration. Nebular calibration offers long-term stability and like the
geocorona and interstellar medium, nebulae are spatially extended line emission
sources.  The nebular calibration method has produced internally consistent 
results for Wisconsin-based geocoronal, planetary, and interstellar medium
observations.
<p>
Inter-calibration of instruments participating in the NSF-CHARM geocoronal
observation campaign of the early 1990s led to unforeseen challenges.
Roesler made a hydrogen hollow cathode lamp placed in a diffusing box that was 
flown to different sites for inter-calibration using a line emission rather than a
continuum emission source.  A study of calibration differences that persisted after the
instruments viewed the lamp indicated that careful consideration was required of 
both the source characteristics and the respective instruments viewing the source.  
Issues that arose included that the instruments saw different portions of the lamp 
emission spectrum depending upon whether they were single- or double-etalon
FPI instruments, and the parasitic light (light from outside the filter bandpass)
differed between instruments.  The CHARM campaign indicated some of the subtle
challenges associated with inter-calibration between optical instruments.

Brian Sharpee spoke about standard star calibration, a method that is the
basis for several other types of calibration.  For example, the nebular calibration 
method discussed by Roesler and the calibration of the Keck echelle spectrographs
discussed by Tom Slanger are methods both tied to standard star calibration.
Standard stars are stars with smooth spectral output and sufficient intensity
to make their use as reference stars practical.  Primary calibration stars have 
been calibrated against blackbody sources.  Sharpee has been using standard 
stars to calibrate the Keck spectrographs.  When performing this calibration it is 
essential that the star be fully enclosed within the field of view of the instrument.
<p>
Tom Slanger spoke about relative calibration of the Keck spectrographs
using emission properties of molecular bands.  The Keck instruments, located at 
Mauna Kea, Hawaii, are high resolution echelle spectrographs used primarily for 
astronomical studies.  The terrestrial emissions in the Keck astronomical spectra 
also provide a rich resource for aeronomical studies.  Slanger spoke about relative 
calibration of emission lines within O2 and OH bands.  The intensity ratios 
between emission lines within these bands are known by atomic and molecular 
spectroscopy.  Once one of the lines within each band has been calibrated using 
standard stars, the calibration can be transferred to other lines within the band by 
using information about relative line intensity within each band.

J. Baumgardner spoke at the 2004 CEDAR Optical Calibration workshop
about calibration of the Boston University spectrograph using Carbon-14 and
laboratory lamp sources, and at this year's workshop focused on techniques used to
characterize and calibrate Boston University's all-sky imagers.  Processing of the 
CCD observational images to correct for instrumental effects involves subtracting 
the CCD bias and the dark thermal noise  (differs with exposure time).   Flat field 
exposures are used to normalize the observational images in order to correct for 
vignetting, i.e. cutting off of light rays, within the instrument.  It is a challenge to 
obtain a spatially and spectrally uniform flat field that fills the field of view of the 
instrument.  At Boston University, researchers use a diffusing light box and a
diffuser at the location of the filter wheel in order to create a flat field used to correct
the imager data.
<p>
Researchers use a tungsten lamp source for intensity calibration of the
Boston all-sky camera observations.  Knowledge of the brightness versus wavelength
of the tungsten lamp as well as the transmission of the interference filter
are both required to accurately calibrate the all-sky images using the tungsten 
lamp source.  It is especially important to accurately characterize the transmission 
properties of the interference filter as the information about filter transmission 
properties supplied by the manufacturer may not be sufficiently accurate to reduce 
calibration errors to below 10%.    In addition to the filter transmission, uncertainties
about tropospheric scattering and atmospheric transmission probably are the
major sources of error in the calibration of the airglow's absolute intensity.

Sam Yee discussed mutual consistency of calculated dissociation and
ionization rates using measurements from the Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) on
board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics
Satellite (TIMED) with rates calculated using overlapping observations from other
instruments.  The SEE instrument observations are compared with long-term 
solar irradiance ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet data from the SOLSTICE
instrument on the UARS satellite and from the SORCE satellite.  The TIMED/SEE
derived O2 photo-dissociation rates and their response to solar activity are found 
to compare favorably with those derived from UARS/SOLSTICE, while those
calculated from SORCE observations are 10-20% less.  Atomic oxygen and N2
photo-ionization rates derived from TIMED/SEE X-ray and EUV measurements 
are generally higher than those calculated using EUV models.  Measurement
discrepancies provide an assessment of the uncertainties associated with
parameters derived from SEE and other satellite observations and used in upper
atmospheric modeling.  The new information from TIMED/SEE suggests that
ionospheric and airglow photochemistry might need to be reexamined.

Mike Taylor reported on the portable Lindau Calibration Photometer used
by European scientists for inter-calibration of optical instruments.  The calibration 
photometer uses a Fritz Peak standard source and makes calibration measurements
at seven wavelengths.  The photometer is easily portable and is used at
annual European Optical meetings for cross-calibration of instruments.
<p>
Participants acknowledged the challenges associated with calibration and
the need to optimize methods for intensity and spectral calibration and
inter-calibration between instruments.   We plan to continue these discussions at next
year's CEDAR workshop.  Please contact us with suggestions regarding the
format of the CEDAR Optical Calibration Techniques and Issues workshop and if you
would like to give a presentation next year.  In addition, we are considering the 
idea of organizing a more extended optics workshop, perhaps in conjunction with 
the annual CEDAR workshop, where instrument characterization and calibration 
along with other optical aeronomy issues can be discussed at greater depth.
