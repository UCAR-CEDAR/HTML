This year the theme of the student workshop was Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MI) coupling.
During the morning we held a joint session with the GEM community where two speakers invited to give
tutorial talks.  The plan was to look at this coupling from `above' (magnetospheric point of view) and from
`below' (ionospheric point of view). The first speaker, Bob McPherron, from UCLA, talked about MI coupling
from the magnetospheric point of view. Basic concepts were introduced as well as the processes that create 
magnetospheric electric fields and how these create field aligned currents that couple the magnetosphere to 
the ionosphere.  The second speaker, Rod Heelis, from UT Dallas, gave a tutorial on MI coupling from the 
ionospheric point of view. He discussed the current systems connecting the ionosphere and magnetosphere 
and the electromagnetic and particle energy inputs. It was interesting to see how similar topics were
presented with different perspectives. The active role of the ionosphere regulating the energy transfer from the
magnetosphere to the ionosphere was clearly shown.

After lunch we held separate workshops, with the CEDAR workshop continuing with the MI coupling
theme. The first speaker was John Foster from MIT Haystack, who stressed the importance of the use of
distributed array of small instruments to study MI coupling and gave some example of space weather effects 
at mid-latitudes. His talk was followed by Cheryl Huang, from AFRL, who showed the presence of low energy
electrons from DMSP, during superstorms. Ionospheric conductances calculations usually underestimate the 
observations during these events, with important consequences for modeling.

The second part of the afternoon session stared with a talk by Stan Sazykin, from Rice University. His
focus was on ionospheric electric fields of magnetospheric origin and how they cause re-distribution of
electron density at low- and mid-latitudes during geomagnetic storms. Shielding effects and Sub-Auroral
Polarization Streams (SAPS) were also discussed. Finally, Dirk Lummerzehin, from the U. of Alaska, talked about
MI coupling using the aurora as a typical example. The ionosphere is modified in the aurora, leading to
upflowing heavy ions that move into the magnetosphere and provide a source of plasma. A comparative study
with the aurora in Jupiter was also presented.

Evaluation forms were handed out to the attendees and the feedback from the students showed that 
in general they were pleased with the level and selection of topics presented. All the talks are available
