<h2 class="style1 style2">MIC SESSIONS FOR GEM 2005 </h2>
<h4 class="style1"><a name="2" id="2"></a>BREAKOUT: Call for participants: Global Ion outflows and the polar wind </h4>
<p class="style1">Monday June 27, 10:30 AM-12:00 PM in La Terraza </p>
<p class="style1">Chairs: Robert Winglee and Bill Peterson</p>
<p class="style1">Specifying the global outflow of ions of all energies and
validating them observations is necessary for progress in global magnetospheric
  models. This session is a follow on to the challenge issued in a joint
session with GGCM campaign at the 2004 summer workshop.   An interval (14:30
on 3/18/97 to 02:00 on 3/19/97) with well defined   solar wind conditions
and mass resolved ion outflow data from   Akebono, Polar, and FAST was identified
as an example. Data for this interval is available at the URL:   <a href="ftp://willow.colorado.edu/pub/exchange/GEM/%20">ftp://willow.colorado.edu/pub/exchange/GEM/ </a>  </p>
<p class="style1">We are interested in hearing from modelers who have used this or  other event data to validate their large scale simulations.   </p>
<p class="style1">We are also interested in hearing about recent global average
observations of the polar wind, energetic ions, and especially observations
on the altitude the rate of energy gain as a function of altitude in the
auroral zone.   </p>
<p class="style1">Other presentations related to ionospheric outflows/polar
wind and their interaction in the magnetosphere and/or plasmasphere are also
welcomed.   </p>
<p class="style1">Please notify the conveners: Robert Winglee <a href="mailto:winglee@geophys.washington.edu%20">winglee@geophys.washington.edu</a>   and Bill Peterson   <a href="mailto:Bill.Peterson@lasp.colorado.edu">Bill.Peterson@lasp.colorado.edu </a>of
your intention to participate.   Please give them a short description of
what you plan to say and how  long you will need to say it.   We want to
encourage discussion so we, strongly encourage short focused presentations.

<p class="style1">Monday June 27, 01:30-03:30 PM in La Terraza </p>
<p class="style1">Chairs: Josh Semeter and Bill Lotko or Peterson</p>
<p class="style1">Large scale magnetospheric models currently account for
the   electromagnetic decoupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere   (associated
with the auroral acceleration, or 'GAP' region) by   invoking the ``Knight
relation" and the "Robinson formulas".   These relations, however, constitute
crude approximations that apply only   to the upward current region. Acceleration
processes and associated  decoupling also occur in downward current regions
and in Alvenic   acceleration on auroral field lines.   </p>
<p class="style1">There is a strong need for practical parameterizations
of this 'gap   region'.   In this session we seek to approach the problem
from a   system identification perspective;   we solicit contributions that
address the question:   What are the critical inputs and outputs   required
to characterize the gap region for global models? </p>
<p class="style1">Please notify the conveners: Josh Semeter ( <a href="mailto:jls@bu.edu">jls@bu.edu</a> ) and Bill Peterson <a href="mailto:Bill.Peterson@lasp.colorado.edu">Bill.Peterson@lasp.colorado.edu</a>

<h4 class="style1"><a name="4" id="4"></a>BREAKOUT: Call for participants: Small scale structuring of the ionosphere and its Influence on M-I coupling </h4>
<p class="style1">Monday June 27, 04:00-06:00 PM</p>
<p class="style1">The structure and composition of the polar ionosphere are
altered   not only by direct forcing (e.g., precipitation, wave heating,
convection, solar production), but also indirectly as a result of   plasma
instabilities (e.g., gradient-drift, Farley-Buneman).   This   induced variability
influences M-I coupling in two broad ways.   First, structure is commensurate
with density gradients which, in turn, lead to polarization fields when currents
are present, affecting the rate and distribution of Joule dissipation.  
Second, any process which affects composition affects the reservoir of ions
available for   magnetospheric extraction.   Plasma transport across an open-close
  field line boundary is such a process.   </p>
<p class="style1">The purpose of this session is to explore physical connections
between processes that structure the high latitude ionosphere and models
of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at all scales.   Particularly encouraged
are new and provocative ideas that address (solidly or speculatively) the
validity of current models.   Lower latitude results that fit into this theme
are also welcome.   </p>
<p class="style1">If you wish to contribute a viewpoint at this session, please notify Josh Semeter ( <a href="mailto:jls@bu.edu">jls@bu.edu</a> ) with a brief description, including how much time you think you would need.   </p>
<h4 class="style1"> <a name="5" id="5"></a>BREAKOUT : Call for participants:  Global MI Coupling: Energy deposition and partitioning</h4>
<p class="style1">Tuesday June 28, 01:30-03:00 PM &amp; 04:00-06:00 PM</p>
<p class="style1">The GEM MI Coupling campaign has added a new working group
this year   to focus on global-scale observations and modeling of distributions
  of currents, electric fields, and ionospheric conductance.   An   associated
topic is the amount, distribution, and partitioning of   energy deposition
in the MI system.   Recent global observations have   provided some of the
first quasi-instantaneous and quasi-global   measurements of the Poynting
flux flowing through the MI interface   [e.g., Waters et al., 2004; Korth
et al., 2005].   These observations supplement existing capabilities of estimating
the global   precipitating particle energy flux into the ionosphere.   Both
of these quantities and their relative amplitudes and distributions are  
critical to global models that now couple to the ITM system.   Poynting flux
has also been found to be a useful parameter for   characterizing ionospheric
outflow processes [Strangeway et al.,   2005].   </p>
<p class="style1">We solicit contributions concerning the observation and
modeling of   global patterns of Poynting flux (at both DC and AC frequencies)
and   precipitating particle energy flux as a function of solar wind and
  IMF driving.   We also solicit presentations that illustrate how   these
drive or effect MI coupling processes such as ionospheric   outflow or thermospheric
heating.   Since this is the first session   of a new working group, we are
particularly interested in brief   presentations and ones that explore or
advocate possible future "GEM   challenges" in this area.   </p>

<h4 class="style1"><a name="1" id="1"></a>BREAKOUT: Call for participants: Auroral Boundaries: Finding Them in Observations and Model Output Files</h4>
<p class="style1">Joint session, Wednesday, June 29 01:30-03:30 PM  in La Fonda Ballroom </p>
<p class="style1">overflow: Thursday June 30, 01:30 -03:30 PM in La Fonda Ballroom </p>
<p class="style1">Chairs: Josh Semeter and Bill Peterson</p>
<p class="style1">GEM modeling has progressed to the point where investigators
are comfortable tracing field lines and identifying the boundary of the open/closed
field lines as the poleward auroral boundary.   </p>
<p class="style1">With the advent of AMISR and support of the large array
of ground   and space based instrumentation that simultaneously cover a  
significant fraction of the auroral oval region it makes sense to   start
thinking about if and how information about the instantaneous   location
of the poleward and equatorward auroral boundaries can be   derived and used
either as ground truth or validation of large scale magnetospheric codes.
  </p>
<p class="style1">We are organizing a breakout session for a discussion of
these issues. In the spirit of the workshop mode, and to provoke thoughtful
discussion, we solicit short, less than 3 viewgraph,   presentations on techniques
for identifying auroral boundaries in   models and data acquired from ground
and space based observatories.   We especially solicit short discussions
on how the equatorward and poleward boundaries of the auroral oval could
be identified in large-scale magnetospheric codes.   We suggest, but do not
require, that presenters focus on the set of well defined intervals that
are the subject of special issues of AGU publications <a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/call4/sunearth04.html">http://www.agu.org/pubs/call4/sunearth04.html</a> : The violent Sun-Earth   connection events of October-November 2003, or the April 2002 events.   </p>
<p class="style1">Please notify the organizers: Josh Semeter, <a href="mailto:jls@bu.edu">jls@bu.edu</a> and W.K. (Bill) Peterson, <a href="mailto:Bill.Peterson@lasp.colorado.edu">Bill.Peterson@lasp.colorado.edu</a> if you plan to present in this session.</p>

Breakout: Call for Participants: How well do Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
reproduce fluctuations on all scales?</h4>
<p class="style1">Wednesday, June 29 04:00-06:00 PM </p>
<p class="style1">This session will challenge modellers and experimenters
to characterise the statistical properties of fluctuations in the M-I system
(e.g.,<br>   power spectra in time and space, probability distributions of
fluctuations (e.g., velocity differences) at varying separations in time<br>
  and space, etc.) and to compare these properties in order to answer specific questions:</p>
<ul class="style1">
  <li>Are there preferred time and space scales?</li>
  <li>Is the M-I system turbulent?</li>
  <li>Are fluctuations the same in models and data?</li>
  <li>What are the limiting scales of models and data?</li>
  <li>Can we parameterise fluctuations on sub-grid scales? (for models and experiments)</li>
  <li>How does our ability to model and measure structure at different scales<br>
    affect space weather prediction? (e.g., contribution of small-scale<br>
    structure to Joule heating, coupling between kinetic and MHD scales in<br>
    reconnection and substorms and aurora, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">The challenge to modellers and experimenters is to look
at much larger quantities of data than usual in order to access varying scales
and get good statistics. How do we do this? Do we need new instruments, computers,
technologies?</p>
