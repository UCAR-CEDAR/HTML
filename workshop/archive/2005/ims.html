for study, this session is open to anyone or any event that addresses an
assessment of radiation belt model performance using in situ data. In particular
contributions on advanced magnetic field modeling for these events are sought.</p>

<p class="style1">Assessment Challenge Defined (from previous GEM messenger announcement):</p>
<p class="style1">The challenge consists of five interlinked parts, applied to two storm periods:</p>
<p class="style1">1.) Provide the highest possible fidelity in-situ data
for relativistic electrons in the inner magnetosphere. The correct "map"
for these measurements is produced in point 2.).</p>
<p class="style1">2.) Provide the best possible dynamic magnetic field model:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1">a) Using the PSD matching technique developed at LANL<br>
    b) Using the T89 modifications developed at FMI or elsewhere<br>
    c) MHD code models<br>
    d) Other</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">3.) Perform model runs for the selected storms. These runs may produce <br>
  their own global magnetic field or use the provided dynamic fields. <br>
  Anticipated models that will be used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1"><br>
    a) UNH-RAM code, Vania Jordanova<br>
    b) Mei Ching Fok's ring current model<br>
    c) Margaret Chen's model<br>
    d) Salammbo pure<br>
    e) Salammbo data assimilation mode</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">4.) Comparison of particle data between model and data, using the <br>
  magnetic field coordinate mappings using the best dynamic fields of 2.).</p>
<p class="style1">5.) Comparison of model-produced magnetic fields with fields of point 2.) .</p>
<p class="style1">Two storm periods have been selected for this challenge:</p>
<p class="style1">October 21-23, 2001<br>
  September 4-9, 2002</p>
<p class="style1">The October 21-23, 2001 has been chosen since it is already
being used for the ring current challenge. The September 4-9, 2002 storm
has been chosen for the existence of geosynchronous pitch angle data and
because it is not an extreme event.</p>

  Phil Erickson (<a href="mailto:pje@haystack.mit.edu">pje@haystack.mit.edu</a>), MIT Haystack Observatory</p>
<p class="style1">2005 June 28, 10:00 AM-12:00 PM, La Fonda Ballroom</p>
<p class="style1">Electric fields at subauroral latitudes play an important
role in determining global ionospheric plasma density distribution, modify
hot ion (ring current) particle behavior, and influence structures in optical
emissions of the diffuse aurora and subauroral airglow. The morphology of
the electric fields is determined by a complicated combination of the electrodynamic
and particle precipitation processes, and the subauroral ionosphere-inner
magnetosphere is a strongly coupled system. As a result, during geomagnetic
disturbances the usual convection electric field can be amplified in the
evening/nighttime subauroral ionosphere leading to strong, poleward, highly
dynamic, and possibly structured electric fields confined to narrow regions
just equatorward of the diffuse aurora that are termed SubAuroral Polarization
Stream (SAPS) events. The term SAPS includes (but is not limited to) SubAuroral
Ion Drift (SAID) and Polarization Jet events.</p>
<p class="style1">A workshop will be held on Tuesday, June 28, at the joint
CEDAR/GEM 2005 meeting, to address outstanding science questions related
to the electrodynamic M-I coupling at subauroral latitudes. Some of the unanswered
questions or topics are:</p>
<ol class="style1"><li>What are the drivers (solar wind, ring current, ionospheric instability) of SAPS electric fields?</li>
  <li>Formation of density gradients and plasma instabilities and waves in the SAPS region.</li>
  <li>What are ionospheric conductivities in the SAPS region and how are they affected by SAPS electric fields?</li>
  <li>Relation of SAPS electric fields to the storm-time dynamics of the plasmasphere and formation of plasmaspheric plumes/tails.</li>
  <li>Proton precipitation at subauroral regions and its possible connection to cold plasmaspheric material and SAPS electric field.</li>
</ol>
<p class="style1">We solicit short and focused contributions, not to exceed
3-4 viewgraphs, that use observations, theory, and modeling to address one
or more of the questions above, or any other related topic. There will be
time for open discussion. If you would like to contribute, please e-mail

  environment. Global MHD codes have already been developed to simulate changes in the global structure
   of the magnetosphere and such codes have recently been coupled to codes that more properly treat 
   ring current development. What is still needed are modules for the inner magnetosphere that are 
   capable of treating energetic particle dynamics and can be coupled with existing large-scale codes.
