CEDAR Workshop Guidelines for Conveners

<h4><font color=red>
!!! TO CONVENER: TRY TO READ AND SHARE THIS WITH THE PARTICIPANTS OF YOUR WORKSHOP 
AND INFORM THEM ABOUT THE FORMAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN!!!</font></h4>

<p>
The CEDAR Workshops have, in response to the growing size of the audience, tended 
more towards mini-AGU sessions, i.e. one brief paper presented after another for 
the entire 'workshop'. The emphasis has been more on work that has been done than
work that is in need of corroborative data or work that could benefit from 
collaboration. This is a valid and useful way to run a small meeting but is not 
the only form that is useful to the community.
<p>
With that in mind we ask that potential conveners consider other ways of 
organizing their workshops. The <em>guiding principles</em> that CEDAR has endorsed since
its inception remain:
<ul>
<li>    When preparing the session format, the conveners should keep in mind that
workshops offer an opportunity for interactive information exchange between 
participants.

<li>    For the students and non-specialists, it is important to introduce the
topic in general terms and provide context.

<li>    The conveners should encourage informal discussions and always allow
enough free time in the schedule for it. They should avoid an 'AGU-type' session
consisting entirely of scripted/scheduled oral presentations.

<li>    In order to insure time for informal discussion, the conveners are
encouraged to set the maximum allowed time (or maximum number of viewgraphs 
allowed) for each workshop presenter and convey this requirement in their workshop 
description. 

<li>    In order to stimulate discussions, the conveners are encouraged to include
in the abstract of their sessions: current issues, serious limitations, 
controversial results, or unsolved problems they would like to be debated during 
the workshop. 

<li>    We encourage you to dedicate the last 15 min of the workshop to review the
major issues raised, to discuss a strategy for solving problems, or to prepare the 
planning of upcoming campaigns or future collaborations.

<li>    Regarding the viewgraphs presentation itself, we encourage the use of
fontsize of 20 or larger.
</ul>
<p>
There seem to be five general types of workshop formats that the organizers may
wish to consider as they consider proposing a CEDAR workshop.
<i><font color=red>Please inform the
CEDAR Workshop committee of your anticipated workshop format:</font></i>
<ol>
<li><h4>Tutorial-type:</h4>
<ul>
<li>    This format could be selected when the workshop is aimed at presenting a
given technique/approach or at introducing a new topic to the community.
<li>    No more than 4 presenters during a 2-hour workshop
<li>    At least 10 min allocated for questions and discussion after each
presentation
<li>    The presentations should be 'archived' as PDF or postscript presentations
on the CEDAR website for future reference.
</ul>
<li><h4>Short-presentation type:</h4>
<ul>
<li>    This format could be selected when the workshop focuses on a
campaign/mission/instrument results.
<li>    No more than 4 viewgraphs per presenter. Avoid an 'AGU-type' session.
The conveners should allot at least 15 min at the end of the session for reviewing 
the present status and discuss the future plans. 
<li>    Ideally some of the material would be 'archived' on the CEDAR website.
</ul>
<li><h4>Round-table type:</h4>
<ul>
<li>    This format is dedicated to a well defined topic or small scale project.
It involves a moderate number of participants. Small rooms with a large, common 
table would be made available to the conveners.
</ul>
<li><h4>Panel discussion:</h4>
<ul>
<li>    Two or more people would take the stand and discuss from different sides,
a controversial topic or a new project. The discussion would be opened to the 
audience for further input and feed-back.
</ul>
<li><h4>Web-enabled presentation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>    This is the most radical departure from the current format: participants
are encouraged to place their material on a website as images, datasets, 
presentations, papers, notes, etc.
<li>    The participants can then access the material before the workshop and may,
in fact, swap information.
<li>    There might be a few pre-planned talks that would address the workshop
topic in the global sense.
<li>    At the workshop, individual participants that have contributed to the
workshop 'database' would be able to present some interesting aspect of the data
that they are working on and describe the questions/issues that they have and what 
they see from their analysis. 
<li>    At some point in the future, we anticipate that the workshops would host
peer-to-peer wireless connections to further enable the cooperative analysis of 
the data at the workshop.
<li>    Ideally some of the material would be tarchivedv on the CEDAR website.
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<em>Some additional thoughts</em> come to mind:

<ul>
<li>    It is tempting to gauge the success of a workshop by how many people
attend it - please try to avoid this mind set. It is more important that we bring
together students and scientists to look at problems and gain new insight than 
that we do head counts.

<li>    It is also tempting to view the success of a workshop in terms of how
tight the schedule is. It may well be that a workshop topic is so exciting that 
it can't be covered in two hours: we suggest that you take part of your two hours
to plan your own dedicated, multi-day workshop to cover the material that could 
not fit in the CEDAR workshop. Meeting rooms for about 20 with a large central
table will be available for informal meetings outside the regular program.
Please, contact Barbara Emery (emery@ucar.edu) for further details.

<li>    Take chances. You will not be refused the opportunity to host another
workshop if your workshop doesn't work out because you tried a new idea and that
implementation was not entirely successful. As scientists we know and appreciate 
the value of a well-conceived experiment. 
</ul>
<p>
Note that the accepted formats for files to post or archive on the CEDAR website 
are: .pdf, Postscript (.ps or .eps), and html.  However, .doc files can be submitted
and either converted to .pdf, .txt, or .html format.  Please submit your descriptions
in .txt with line breaks or .doc format since they will be altered to conform
to a common layout on the web and in hard copy form.
<p>
Workshop conveners need to also supply to the workshop organizers the following 
information <font color=red>(by 11 April 2005)</font>:
<ul>
<li>    title of the workshop
<li>    plans and workshop format (the five encouraged formats given above)
<li>    conflicts with other workshop to avoid (provide subjects or name of
campaigns/missions/instruments, when applicable) 
<li>    duration (2 hours by default)
<li>    estimated attendance (for the choice of the room)
<li>    initial ascii short description
<li>    any special requests
</ul>
Later on <font color=red>(by 1 June 2005)</font>, a better workshop description will be required for
the web and also as hard-copy for the meeting. The web material discussed above 
will be linked to the workshop description on the web. 
<p>
Please send any comments on these guidelines to Marina Galand (mgaland@bu.edu) 
and/or Larry Paxton (larry.paxton@jhuapl.edu).
