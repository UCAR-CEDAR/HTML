<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>
The Arctic and Antarctic Oscillations (AO, AAO) are the surface
manifestation of the Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM, SAM)
which represent the primary mode of axisymmetric variability in the
high-latitude troposphere and stratosphere. Although the time scale of
annular-mode variation is quite different between the troposphere and
lower stratosphere, being considerably shorter in the troposphere, the
state of the winter tropospheric annular-mode anomaly is biased in the
direction of the stratospheric anomaly after the onset of a large
positive or negative stratospheric anomaly. This bias lasts for 60
days or more, much longer than the time scale of tropospheric
annular-mode variation (~10 days). The stratosphere annular mode
provides an apparent predictive skill for the troposphere in the
subseasonal range, beyond the limit of numerical weather
prediction. In fact, the stratospheric annular-mode signature provides
a better explanation of future tropospheric AO or AAO variability than
the tropospheric anomaly itself.

<p>
Enhanced coupling and predictive skill are observed only at those
times of year when planetary-scale Rossby waves propagate from the
troposphere to middle atmosphere. This time span corresponds to the
extended winter season in the northern hemisphere, but is restricted
to the beginning and end of the southern-hemisphere extended winter
season.
