<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>The dynamical impact of the 11-year solar cycle is investigated with
the focus on the
<br>

stratopause region where solar ultraviolet heating is greatest. The
results of the analysis
<br>

suggest that in a climatological mean state, the stratopause circulation
evolves from a
<br>

radiatively controlled state to one dynamically controlled during winter
in both hemispheres.
<br>

The solar cycle effect appears as a change in the balance between the
radiatively and
<br>

dynamically controlled states. The radiatively controlled state lasts
longer during the solar
<br>

maximum phase and the stratopause subtropical jet reaches a higher
speed. The large
<br>

dynamical response to relatively weak radiative forcing may be understood
by the bi-modal
<br>

nature of the winter atmosphere due to interaction with meridionaly
propagating planetary
<br>

waves and zonal-mean zonal winds.
