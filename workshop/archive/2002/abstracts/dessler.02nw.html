<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>I will review the state of our knowledge of water vapor in the middle
atmosphere.
<br>

The source of water in this region istransport from the troposphere
and oxidation
<br>

of methane. The primary sink is transport back to the troposphere.
Water vapor
<br>

plays an important role in the chemistry of this region as a source
of OH and as a
<br>

primary component of the particles on which heterogeneous chemistry
takes place.
<br>

As a result, middle atmospheric water vapor helps determine the abundance
of
<br>

stratospheric ozone and the size of the annual polar ozone holes. Recent
observations
<br>

of increasing abundances of stratospheric water vapor and their potentially
significant
<br>

repercussions for stratospheric ozone will be discussed. Finally, I
will speculate on
<br>

future research directions for middle atmospheric water and the role
WACCM can play.
