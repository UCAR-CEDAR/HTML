<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>The mesosphere/lower thermosphere and ionosphere (MLTI) region (ca.
80-150 km) hosts a
<br>

complex interplay between dynamics, energetics, electrodynamics and
chemistry over a range
<br>

of spatial and temporal scales. The MLTI includes the mesopause (ca.
85-95 km), the coldest
<br>

temperature minimum in the atmosphere. Phenomena typically associated
with the region
<br>

include tides; gravity waves and planetary waves; wave dissipation;
non-LTE CO2 cooling;
<br>

radiative cooling by NO; absorption of EUV solar radiation, joule heating;
turbulent and
<br>

molecular diffusion of heat and momentum; transport of constituents;
magnetic field influences
<br>

and ion-neutral collisions; plasma instabilities and irregularities.
The dynamics of the MLTI is
<br>

dominated by meteorological influences in the lower part of the domain,
transitioning to solar
<br>

and geomagnetic driving at higher altitudes; hence many of the above
phenomena and processes
<br>

possess a characteristic transition height within the MLTI determined
by competing time scales.
<br>

Optical emissions often represent the final manifestation of a chain
of dynamical and chemical
<br>

processes, and therefore offer a valued means of assessing and validating
models. The objective
<br>

of this talk is to provide a broad overview of the primary dynamical
phenomena occurring in
<br>

the MLTI, and to identify the crucial issues for future study.
