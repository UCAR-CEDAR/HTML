<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>The development of the WACCM in concert with the launch of numerous
remote sensing
<br>satellites offers a unique opportunity to assess the entire atmosphere
as a single entity from
<br>the surface to the edge of space. The Terra, Aqua, Aura, and TIMED
satellites will provide
<br>measurements of the thermal structure from the Earth's surface to the
middle thermosphere,
<br>of the radiative energy balance of the planet and atmosphere, of the
vertical profiles of
<br>radiative heating and radiative cooling (including the all-important
exothermic chemical
<br>heating in the mesosphere), of the vertical profiles of moisture and
chemical composition,
<br>and of cloud properties and sea surface temperature. These data, combined
with the
<br>WACCM, with allow us to explore coupling between atmospheric layers
and upward and
<br>downward propagating influences throughout the atmosphere. A host of
exciting scientific
<br>opportunities exists with these data and WACCM including: Resolving
the mesospheric
<br>diurnal tide using multiple satellites; Evaluating equator-to-pole
energy transport as a
<br>function of altitude; Evaluating the influence of cloud radiative forcing
throughout the
<br>entire atmosphere; Evaluating the effects of major air-sea exchange
events (e.g., ENSO)
<br>on the entire atmosphere; and evaluating the influence of solar variability.
These scientific
<br>studies will provide knowledge central to understanding the Earth system
and to development
<br>of improved prediction capability of future climate.
