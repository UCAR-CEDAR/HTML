<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>Understanding tropical convection and its variability is an essential
step towards a realistic
<br>

simulation of tropical dynamics with General Circulation Models (GCMs).
The aim of our
<br>

research is to show the extent to which misrepresentation of convective
variability and resolved
<br>

equatorial waves in GCMs are responsible for deficiencies in the simulation
of tropical dynamical
<br>

phenomena such as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and the semiannual
oscillation (SAO).
<br>

For this purpose, we tested the behavior of the NCAR Community Climate
Model CCM3 and
<br>

other GCMs in a set of simulations using different parameterizations
of deep convection.
<br>

Convective heating spectra, space and time scale of simulated convective
activity, and equatorial
<br>

wave excitation are investigated. A similar analysis conducted on convective
heating inferred
<br>

from observed cloud data is considered here for model validation. The
role of convectively-excited
<br>

equatorial waves in tropical dynamics of the middle atmosphere is then
investigated comparing
<br>

momentum flux spectra inferred from the observation with the spectra
from several models
<br>

which were more or less successful in the simulation of the QBO and
SAO.
