<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<p>Abstract:

<p>The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in zonal wind in the equatorial
stratosphere results from wave mean-flow interaction. This mechanism transforms
high frequency variability of tropical vertically propagating waves excited
by troposheric tropical meteorology to a quasi-biennial oscillation of
the zonal wind in the stratosphere. The QBO exerts filtering on the wave
spectrum propagating to higher layers and therefore may contribute to the
interannual variability of wave mean-flow interaction in higher regions.
The QBO is a robust phenomenon, in the sense that no QBO cycle broke down
during the available observation record. Nevertheless modelling the QBO
in GCMs is still a challenge and there is only a small number of GCMs that
have shown an equatorial oscillation, some of them having rather quasi-
annual than quasi-biennial periods. Here we show that the QBO is successfully
simulated in a general circulation model of the newest generation. Key
factors are a sufficient spatial resolution, a realistic simulation of
tropical convection, and the consideration of the effects of gravity waves.
From this simulation it is inferred that a broad spectrum of atmospheric
waves is necessary to generate the QBO in the model. Sensitivity tests
address the role of the parameterized gravity wave drag and the sensitivity
of the simulated QBO to modifications of the parameterization for deep
convection.
