<b><font face=arial black>WORKSHOP OBJECTIVE: </b></font><br>
Coordinated investigation of the MLTI response to the
17-24 April 2002 magnetic storms and solar particle events with special
focus on the 17-18 April TIMED-CEDAR magnetic storm campaign.

<p>
<b><font face=arial black>MAGNETIC STORM DRIVERS:</font></b><br>
Solar active region 9906 produced a series of
geoeffective events during 17-24 April 2002 -- 2 halo CMEs as it traversed
the solar disk and, as it approached the sun's limb, an X-class flare and
solar particle event accompanied by a CME (not aimed directly at Earth) as
seen by SOHO and TRACE. All of the CME's lifted off the sun with high
velocity, and thus ACE observed them arrive at Earth in a relatively short
time driving shocked solar wind plasma accompanied by significant
populations of soft (10's of keV to few MeV) solar particles.

<p>
<b><font face=arial black>INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS AT EARTH: </font></b><br>
The first interplanetary CME
triggered a magnetic storm (min provisional Dst ~-100 nT) on April 17 which
did not fully recover before the second CME hit on April 19 producing a
second magnetic storm (min provisional Dst ~-150 nT). Throughout the 7-day
interval NOAA POES observed the polar cap bathed in different species and
energy ranges of solar particles. Soft protons (and electrons in the first
storm) entered the polar cap with each CME and hard solar protons expelled
by the X-class flare filled the polar cap for more than 48 hours at a time
when magnetic activity was low. On April 23, the magnetosphere was clipped
by the third CME which produced only weak magnetic activity levels (min
provisional Dst~-50nT). After this series of events, evidence from Polar
and NOAA POES suggests that the proton and electron radiation belts were
modified, providing a long-lived source of high-energy precipitating
particles for the MLTI region. There were several interesting features in
the auroral oval during this sequence of storms. The auroral emissions and
particle precipitation observed by FAST had unusual fine-scale structure.
During April 18 and possibly other intervals, sawtooth oscillations (not
yet understood but thought to be associated with "global" substorm-related
activity) were observed by LANL geosynchronous satellites. IMAGE and TIMED
captured the intensification of broad regions of the auroral oval which
appear to be associated with these sawtooth oscillations. The strong
driving of auroral activity resulted in a double oval configuration clearly
seen by IMAGE, FAST and TIMED. Bright proton auroras were observed
throughout the storm sequence. Dramatic perturbations in NO, mesospheric
ozone, atmospheric composition and heating were documented by TIMED.

<p>
<b><font face=arial black>DATA SETS: </font></b><br>
During the first magnetic storm in the series on 17-18 April
2002 (Kp~6-7), coordinated observations were made jointly by the TIMED
satellite and a globally-distributed set of ground based instruments,
including Incoherent Scatter radars, SuperDarn HF radars, Medium Frequency
and Meteor Wind radars, lidars, Fabry-Perot Interferometers, and optical
imagers. Other satellites also made supporting observations. The
measurements were coordinated by the CEDAR-TIMED storm project. A
wide-variety of satellites (including ACE, IMAGE FUV, ENA and EUV
instruments, FAST, DMSP, NOAA POES, SAMPEX, SNOE, LANL geosynchronous
satellites, GOES, and POLAR) observed different aspects of this event and
members of these satellite teams are either currently collaborating or are
being sought to join us in an analysis of these events.

<p>
<b><font face=arial black>WORKSHOP GOALS: </font></b><br>
The goals of the workshop are<br>

<ol>

<li type=1>
to make a first assessment of the data collected by the various ground and space
instruments, and

<li>
to develop the plans for the joint analysis of the data by the CEDAR community 
and for the study of this event through globalmodels.<br><br>

</ol>

<p>
Interested participants should bring their data and their ideas for
analyzing or modeling the event to the workshop, and should contact both
convenors prior to the meeting for allocation of time on the agenda.

<p>
<b><font face=arial black>FUTURE PLANS:</font></b><br>
These events will form the basis for a special session
proposal for the Fall 2002 AGU meeting joint with SH/SM/SA leading
ultimately to a set of papers collected into a special section of one of
the journals. In preparation for this special session, a workshop is being
planned for sometime in August to facilitate interactions between the
aeronomy, ionospheric, magnetospheric, heliospheric and solar research
communities. In addition, there are plans to hold a 2-day workshop at
Millstone Hill in the late October- early November 2002 time frame focused
on aspects related to the ground-based 17-18 April 2002 magnetic storm
campaign.
