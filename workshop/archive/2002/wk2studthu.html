The purpose of this trip is to go into Boulder to take a tour of
the NCAR computer lab (11th most powerful in nation), go hiking, and
go into town in Boulder.  We leave after lunch.
Tours at the NCAR Mesa Lab (30 minutes away at 1850 Table Mesa Drive,
Rene Munoz, 303-497-1173, munoz@ucar.edu) will start at 2:00 or sooner.
There are hikes in the Foothills starting from the Mesa Lab, and
a science store.  Return van transportation
leaves the Mesa Lab at 4:30, and will drop any students off
at the Mall in Boulder who wish to return later to Longmont on
the M bus.  Others will return to the conference hotel in time
to go to dinner and to go to the Longmont Theatre.
