The purpose of this CEDAR workshop is to provide a forum for the Space 
and Atmospheric Sciences group at Arecibo to interact with our users 
(and potential users). We will be presenting the latest news regarding
<ul>
<li>the completion of the dual beam upgrade
<li>progress of our new datataking system
<li>status and highlights of our LIDAR program
<li>the future of ionospheric interactions (i.e. HF facility) at Arecibo
<li>workshops that we hope to hold on site in the coming year
</ul>
We invite all to come ready with their questions/comments/complaints
and look forward to having a lively
discussion.
