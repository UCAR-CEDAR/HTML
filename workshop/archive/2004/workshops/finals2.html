C/NOFS (Communication and Navigation Outage Forecast System) is a satellite mission 
dedicated to forecasting ionospheric densities, irregularities and scintillation. It will be 
launched early in 2005 in a 13 degrees inclination, 725 x 375 km orbit.  It will have
instruments that will provide plasma parameters, electric and magnetic fields (AC and DC),
density fluctuations, and neutral wind.  It will also have a GPS receiver, and an RF beacon.
Ground-based instruments to monitor the ionosphere and the scintillation parameters 
are an integral part of the mission. 

<p>
The purpose of this workshop was to:
<ul>
<li>    Plan specific campaigns related to C/NOFS
<li>    Define collaborative projects that involve ground and space measurements
<li>    Discuss the strength and limitations of the various approaches to nowcast and
       forecast ionospheric and scintillation parameters at low latitudes 
</ul>

<p>
Information on C/NOFS is available in <a href="http://www.vs.afrl.af.mil/factsheets/cnofs.html"

<p>
The announcement of opportunity for a joint NASA/NSF science program related to
C/NOFS and equatorial ionosphere is schedule to go out as soon as the NASA reorganization
is accomplished. 
<p>
Major issues that were discussed, concerning the ambient ionosphere / thermosphere, and 
equatorial plasma irregularities included the following: 
<ul>
<li>  Role of wind shears, tides, gravity waves and E-region conductivity in the onset and
damping of equatorial irregularities
<li>  Modeling of perturbation electric field at low latitudes, and its dependence on solar wind,
magnetospheric parameters, as well as ambient ionosphere 
<li>  New and innovative techniques for ionospheric and thermospheric remote measurements
</ul>

The following contributions were made:
