The session was well attended with about 50 attendees.  The session
began with a tribute to Les Hale, who passed away on December 26,
2003.  Les was the principal investigator on over 100 sounding rocket
flights and made numerous contributions to our understanding of the
conductivity and composition of the middle atmosphere.  Les was highly
influential to many other research topics such as the global electric
circuit, waveguide propagation, and electromagnetic interference, to
name a few.
<p>
The main thrust of presentations and discussions for the workshop were
divided into two main areas: 
<ol>
 <li>theoretical and recent campaign results
 <li>future research campaigns
</ol>
<p>
The energetic lightning discharges which produce sprites can cause the
entire earth-ionosphere cavity to oscillate at the Schumann Resonance
frequencies.  Heng Yang (Penn State) showed with his model how these
frequencies are modified by X-ray bursts and Solar Proton Events
(SPEs).  Laurie Triplett (Los Alamos National Laboratory) used a model
to predict when the sprite-producing discharges would produce runaway
beams and/or narrow streamers as well as the intensities of the
optical emission lines.  There was active discussion afterwards about
whether sprites ever exist without fine structure in the form of
streamers.  Ningyu Liu (Penn State) showed results from his streamer
model which he has used to predict streamer parameters such as the
minimum propagation field, velocity, dimensions, and decay, to name a
few.

William Beasley (Oklahoma University) discussed the very recent
research campaign which was conducted from May 13 to June 21 in
association with the TELEX experiment based out of Oklahoma.  Aaron
Musfeldt looked for sprites with low-light level cameras at night
while instrumented balloons were flown with X-ray detectors both
within and above storms.  They are just beginning to process the data
and are seeking collaborations with others who may have relevant data
during the time period of interest.
<p>
The future research campaigns which were discussed could also benefit
from collaborations and the infusion of additional data sources.
Stephen Mende (University of California, Berkeley) discussed two
projects, SOCRATES and ISUAL, the latter of which had just started
collecting data from space on sprites, elves, and lightning.  The
SOCRATES experiment will hopefully take place in July of 2005 with
balloon-based electric field probes acquiring data above
sprite-producing storms over the Great Plains while video of sprites
are acquired at various sites.  Mark Stanley (Los Alamos National
Laboratory) gave an overview of the sprite campaign to be conducted at
Langmuir Laboratory in mid-July and August 4-21 by researchers from
Stanford and elsewhere.  Hans Stenbaek-Nielsen (University of Alaska,
Fairbanks) discussed his high-speed spectral imaging experiment which
will be deployed in August at Langmuir and will attempt to resolve
whether sprite processes are important for the physics and chemistry
of the mesosphere.  Mike Taylor (Utah State University) discussed the
second Brazil campaign, which is slated to take place in February and
November of 2005 and will utilize balloons outfitted with X-ray
detectors.
<p>
At the end of the session, there was active discussion about key
issues in our field.  The initiation of sprites as well as the
transition of some sprites from a column to a carrot appearance were
identified as two main scientific problems which need to be tackled.
The need for more spectral information on the development of sprites
was stated as being essential data in discriminating between some
competing theories.  It was also stressed by one member that in order
to get more funding, we need to emphasize issues which are more than
just scientifically interesting and have some practical or
far-reaching importance as well.
