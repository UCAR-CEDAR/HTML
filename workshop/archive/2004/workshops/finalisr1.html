This workshop focused on current and future efforts to deploy and use 
radio and radar instrumentation networks for CEDAR related science. The 
purpose of the workshop was to provide a forum for discussing current 
efforts and insights in this regard. The workshop was attended by 
approximately 50 people. The first hour of the workshop was taken up by 
a series of four invited talks. The remaining hour was dedicated to more 
open discussions.
<p>
The first speaker was John Foster of MIT who discussed DASI : 
Distributed Arrays of Small Instruments. DASI is currently a project 
under development to enable the deployment of a wide range of 
instrumentation to provide wide spatial coverage of geospace using 
ground based sensor networks. This would happen through a Major Research 
Equipment (MRE) proposal to NSF at some point in the future. John 
reported on the intent of DASI as well as a recent (June 2004) NRC 
workshop in Wood's Hole, MA where the science rationale of DASI was 
discussed. DASI will need from the start to be a community effort but 
there is great enthusiasm for the science potential particularly when 
these types of instruments are combined with assimilative modeling. John 
gave examples of the power of distributed arrays of small instruments 
using GPS TEC mapping examples for observations of Storm Enhanced 
Density regions of the American sector.

The second speaker was Ray Greenwald of JHU/APL who discussed the 
SuperDARN network. Ray provided an overview of the the current SuperDARN 
deployment and planned expansions both in the north and southern 
hemispheres. Of particular note were efforts to provide new SuperDARN 
radar systems at mid-latitudes which will provide coverage during 
geomagnetic events. Ray provided an extensive discussion of logistical 
issues associated with SuperDARN as well as the role of international 
collaborations in fielding a distributed radar system. Ray placed 
emphasis on the need to have uniform data standards and a formalized 
means of gathering and distributing data.

The third speaker was Brent Ledvina of Cornell University who discussed 
software radio GPS receivers. Brent described the efforts at Cornell to 
develop implementations of GPS receivers where the primary signal 
processing is all performed on general purpose computers. This enables 
easy reconfiguration of the receivers as new navigation signals become 
available (e.g. GPS L5, Galileo, etc.) and allows customization of the 
receiver to observation tasks such as high rate scintillation 
monitoring. Brent discussed the advantages of software radios the 
primary of which are their performance, flexibility, and lower cost. He 
also showed examples from his current software radio implementation for 
L1 GPS signals and discussed performance constraints.

The fourth speaker was Frank Lind of MIT who discussed the Intercepted 
Signals for Ionospheric Science (ISIS) array. The ISIS Array is a 
distributed instrument project which has received $500k USD in hardware 
funding from the DoD Defense University Instrumentation (DURIP) program. 
The ISIS project is a prototype coherent software radio network capable 
of operating as a flexible multi-role distributed radio science 
instrument. In particular operational modes involving active and passive 
multistatic radar imaging, satellite beacon observation of TEC and 
scintillation, and radio intercept and TDOA applications will be 
supported over a wide range of operating frequencies (0.5 to 2000 MHz). 
The system will be constructed of a series of MIDAS-Mobile nodes 
(Millstone Data Acquisition System) which can coherently capture wide 
bandwidths of RF signals from a variety of antennas. The array will be 
capable of applying high performance supercomputing to the real time and 
batch processing requirements of a variety of experiments. Initial 
Deployment of the ISIS Array is expected to happen in summer 2005 with 
five nodes in the Northeast U.S. and two nodes in the Northwest.

Additional questions and discussions followed the main presentations and 
there was considerable enthusiasm for the above topics. After the main 
presentations the open discussion section of the workshop allowed short 
presentations by other interested parties. Bill Wright of NOAA discussed 
progress on the development of a new Dynasonde design using digital 
receivers and software radio approaches. Some discussion also occurred 
on the role of distributed instruments in supporting AMISR. In 
particular the logistical challenges were discussed along with the 
potential utility of orienting AMISR to take advantage of the expanded 
observational capabilities currently being deployed in Canada. At the 
end of the workshop the audience and participants were asked if this 
type of workshop should be organized again next year. It was clearly 
indicated that additional workshops on this topic should be organized in 
the future at CEDAR and other meetings.
