 Accurate calibration is important for comparing observations taken
by different instruments, for model-data comparisons, and for acquiring
long term data records.  A recurring theme throughout the workshop was
that calibration poses a major instrumental challenge for observers.  
Consistent calibration techniques are critically important when multiple
observers contribute to a long term data set and when there are upgrades
to the instrument(s) acquiring the data set.  Participants addressed
absolute and relative intensity calibration, as well as spectral
calibration.  The workshop included a series of short tutorial
presentations describing a variety of calibration techniques used by
observers in the CEDAR community and discussion of how to move forward to
assist our community in optimizing calibration of optical instruments.  
Many of the ~50 participants were students who are working with a variety
of optical instruments.

Observers at both the Arecibo Observatory and at Boston University
use a low brightness Carbon-14 source to calibrate ground based optical
photometers and spectrometers.  However, such a radioactive source is not
easily transportable.  At the Arecibo Observatory, the Carbon-14
calibrated photometer is then used to cross-calibrate the Fabry-Perot by
having both instruments simultaneously view the same patch of sky [R.  
Kerr].  A tungsten filament bulb is used by Boston University for
cross-calibration of field instruments.  This intermediate source is
calibrated against the Carbon-14 source at the home institution and then
used for calibration of the Boston University spectrograph at remote sites

[J. Baumgardner]</a>.  The spectral dispersion of the spectrograph is
calibrated through use of laboratory lamps

<p>
Accurate knowledge of the filter bandpass and transmission profile
is crucial for reducing uncertainties in Carbon-14 and laboratory lamp
brightness calibrations [R. Kerr and
<a href="baumgardner.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
J. Baumgarder</a>].  This information is
especially important when using a continuum source to calibrate a
monochromatic emission from the sky.  In addition, it is important to
characterize the bandpass filter shift to the blue with off-normal
incidence angle.
<p>
The astronomical community commonly uses standard stars for
brightness calibrations
<a href="sharpee.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
[B. Sharpee]</a>.  The calibration of these stars is
tied to blackbody sources.  Standard stars are used to calibrate the Keck
II Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) from which aeronomers at SRI
obtain the terrestrial spectra contained in the instrument's astronomical
observations.  When performing standard star calibrations it is crucial
that the standard star fall completely within the field of view of the
slit utilized by the observer so that the star's entire intensity is
captured

<p>
A nebular calibration method is used for intensity calibration of
the University of Wisconsin's geocoronal, galactic, and cometary
observations
<a href="mierkiewicz.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
[E. Mierkiewicz]</a>.  Wisconsin observers point to a patch of
the North American Nebula that has been calibrated at the H-alpha
wavelength using Standard Stars.  Calibrations at other wavelengths close
to H-alpha can be estimated using knowledge of how the filter transmission
and CCD quantum efficiency vary with wavelength.  Transferring the
calibration to H-beta utilizes the filter transmission, CCD quantum
efficiency, and atomic physics H-beta/H-alpha line ratios.  Nebular
calibration offers the advantages of a stable calibration source, a line
emission source, and being outside of the Earth's atmosphere, minimizing
uncertainty due to atmospheric extinction.  Disadvantages include however,
that nebular calibration requires that the instrument have accurate
pointing capabilities and that the nebula emit in a wavelength region
close to that of the observation of interest

The Wisconsin group uses narrow laboratory lamp emissions for
their characterization of the instrumental profile and calibration of
spectral dispersion
<a href="mierkiewicz.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
[E. Mierkiewicz]</a>.  A primary challenge of this method
is to diffuse the lamp light so that it fills the instrument in a similar
manner to the observed atmospheric emissions.
<p>
The TIDI instrument on board the TIMED satellite makes global wind
measurements of the middle atmosphere.  Approximately 5% of the TIDI
measurement time is spent on calibration related measurements to insure
instrument stability and to characterize any shifts in the instrument
during the operation of the TIMED mission
<a href="niciejewski.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
[R. Niciejewski]</a>.  TIDI makes
these assessments by observing multiple laboratory lamps and through
photon transfer tests to assess the stability of the Charge Coupled Device
camera.
<p>
Several strategies were discussed to help aeronomers optimize
their optical calibration methods.  One is to use a clone of the Keck
Spectrograph as a brightness calibration source [T. Slanger].  
Atmospheric emission bands of known intensity ratios would be used to
cross-calibrate a second optical instrument over a wide spectral range.
<p>
Another approach is to create a portable calibration instrument.
European scientists use the Lindau Calibration Photometer for
inter-calibration of instruments and cross-calibration of calibration
methods
<a href="taylor.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
[M. Taylor]</a>. The calibration photometer uses a Fritz Peak standard
source and makes calibration measurements at seven wavelengths.  This
photometer is easily portable and is used at annual European Optical
Meetings for cross-calibration of instruments.  The CEDAR community could
consider development of a similar instrument.
<p>
Another suggestion made at the workshop was to install
monochrometers at the Upper Atmospheric Facilities to enable measurement
of filter transmissions.  Accurate measurement of the filter transmission
properties is required for several calibration techniques.  Observers
could bring their filters to these facilities to better characterize their
filter properties.
<p>
Calibration was acknowledged as a continuing challenge for optical
observers.  Participants suggested that a discussion of calibration
strategies and suggestions be incorporated into the Passive Optics
Assessment and associated proposals.  Most of the tutorial presentations
from the Optical Calibration workshop can be found
on the CEDAR website
(http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu, click on 'Workshop', on 'Workshops', and
then on 'Final Report' for OL2).
We also plan to organize a follow-up workshop for next
year's CEDAR meeting.  Please contact us with suggestions regarding the
format for this workshop and if you'd like to give a presentation.
