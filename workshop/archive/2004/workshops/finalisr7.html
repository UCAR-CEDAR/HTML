We held a short presentation style workshop, with the following list of 
speakers, Joe Grebowsky, Bill Bristow, James Boulter, Diego Janches, 
Lars Dyrud, Meers Openheim, Patrick Roddy, John Sahr, and Stan
Briczinski.  The speakers and the topics discussed reflected the
multi-disciplinary nature of this field.  Topics included the meteor 
deposition of metal layers, and whether meteor ablation or subsequent
transport is responsible for altitude stratification of species such as 
Mg and Fe.  Subjects as varied as laboratory experiments of chemistry of 
meteoric dust, modeling of long duration meteor trails, and new 
observations from SuperDarn, South Pole, Arecibo, and passive radar near 
Seattle, all demonstrated the growing interest by the community in the 
effects and understanding of meteors and the mesopause.  Finally, the
convenors, Diego Janches and Lars Dyrud would like to thank everyone 
that took part and attended this years workshop.
