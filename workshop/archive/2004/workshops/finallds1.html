50 people attended the "Contributions to the climatology of the upper atmosphere by
optical techniques associated with the Upper Atmosphere Facilities' workshop Thursday
afternoon, July 1 2004. This enthusiastic response resulted in the workshop extending 
from 3:45 to 6:45 pm.


<p>
The workshop goals focused on climatological studies related to long-term synoptic
neutral wind and temperature observations. Specifically, studies relating to long-term
characterization of the climatology of the upper atmosphere (Global Change/Space Weather)
were presented as well as relevant modeling studies. At the 2003 CEDAR meeting, related 
workshops included "The Fabry-Perot Interferometer Workshop" chaired by John
Meriwether, Jr., and the "Topside Workshop" led by John Noto. These workshops described
recent advances in technology and optical observations of exospheric parameters,
respectively. The 2004 Climatology Workshop built upon the tradition of observing state
variables with optical interferometers and the science problems that can be addressed by these
measurements.


<p>
The Upper Atmosphere Facilities, the infrastructure at Kitt Peak in Arizona and at the 
EISCAT facilities in Europe provide a convenient platform for optical aeronomy and
synoptic measurements. New findings related to upper atmosphere climatology were
presented from all of these sites describing
<ol type=i>
<li>solar cycle dependences on neutral winds at high and middle latitudes
<li>solar cycle dependences on neutral hydrogen abundance in the exosphere
<li>hot neutral helium abundance in the exosphere
</ol>
Specifically, several
talks were presented that showed the need for collocated optical and radar climatological 
measurements describing both the neutral thermosphere and the F-region ionosphere. A 
new emphasis for empirical modeling towards predicting thermodynamics in the upper 
thermosphere during magnetic storms was discussed. Attempts at predicting fine spatial 
details in neutral wind morphology and their associated difficulties were presented. The 
climatological description of the neutral atmosphere, made possible by optical measurements
from a chain of observatories, was also discussed including the creation of a small
South American chain involving Fabry Perot interferometers from Clemson and Scientific 
Solutions.


<p>
A rousing discussion resulted from Bob Kerr's talk on the NSF perspective on passive 
optical observations. Discussions began with the question of whether the Upper
Atmospheric Facilities (UAF) directorate should be required to fund optical observations. This
extended to how the optical community feels about facility optics in general and it's
funding model, and what we can do as a community to further optical observations. Mention
was made of improving capabilities at the existing observatories by upgrading extant 
instrumentation with class one detectors such as CCD cameras and adding spectrometers. 
The stability of a long-term synoptic observation strategy is dependent upon repeated 
measurements with a group of standard and fixed experiments. The manpower and equipment
resources that have provided these measurements have reached a stage where serious
component failures or retirements are a real concern. The future challenges that were
identified for the community are to:
<ol type=i>
<li>articulate the need for long-term climatological observations
<li>to consolidate resources into a common consortium effort
<li>to maintain and upgrade the current instrumentation base
</ol>
Work proceeding towards these goals will
be embodied in the forthcoming Passive Optics Workshop Report to the CEDAR Science 
Steering Committee in November 2004.
