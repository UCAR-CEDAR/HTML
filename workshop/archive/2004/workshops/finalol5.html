This panel workshop was attended by over 50 CEDAR researchers.  The workshop
objective was to: Identify and prioritize scientific questions concerning the middle
atmosphere that can be addressed by lidar.  The workshop featured presentations by five panelists;
<ol>
<li>Stephen Eckermann: Gravity waves in the middle atmosphere: Science questions and
future directions
<li>Ruth Lieberman: Lidar support for studies of global MLT waves
<li>Daniel Marsh: Chemistry of the middle atmosphere
<li>Andrew Gerrard: Towards the realization of thermospheric lidar systems
<li>Alan Liu: Multi-instrument synergism and clustering
</ol>
The panelists presentations were followed by a question-and-answer open discussion.
<p>
All of the panelists discussed the role that lidars might play in providing high-resolution measurements of 
winds, temperatures and constituents that could advance current understanding of the Earth's middle
atmosphere.  They agreed that these measurements are critical for understanding the distribution of minor
species, synoptic-scale weather events, tidal and planetary wave variability, wave-driven fluxes, and
non-migrating tides. The panelists noted that in addition to wind and temperature measurements, the measurement
of minor species distributions is an important benchmark for modeling both diffusive and turbulent
transport. The panelists also noted that current model simulations contain ambiguities as they can yield 
similar results with packages that are based on different physical mechanisms.

<p>
The panelists urged the CEDAR lidar community to;
<ul>
<li> Improve communication between researchers in the CEDAR modeling and observing communities.
They encouraged researchers in both communities to better define complementary simulations and 
observations that answer definitive questions (e.g. flux measurements, wave and tidal characteristics,
minor species distributions, wave-breaking parameterizations).
<li> Address challenges in assimilating satellite and model results and high-lighted the contribution of
ground-based observations to the understanding of non-migrating tides and planetary waves. They 
encouraged researchers to develop assimilation methods that can combine measurements from 
ground-based networks with measurements from satellites and global models and encouraged 
observers to better coordinate regional observing strategies.
<li> Extend the scope of current lidar measurements beyond the mesopause region to cover the entire
middle and upper atmosphere.
<li> Develop both single-site advanced instrument clusters (of lidars, radars, photometers, and imagers)
that can yield specific measurements (e.g. wave-driven fluxes) to and multi-site chains of (perhaps 
less-advanced) but cross-calibrated lidars that yield measurements over planetary scales (e.g.
temperature structure of non-migrating tides and planetary waves).
