A workshop entitled
<a href="ca1schedule.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
"Comparative Aeronomy on Earth and Mars"</a> was held on
Tuesday 27 July as part of the 2004 CEDAR Meeting in Sante Fe, New Mexico.
Approximately 100 people attended. The aim of the workshop was to
stimulate an interest in comparative aeronomy among scientists working in
terrestrial aeronomy. Speakers were asked to describe some aspect of the
aeronomy of Mars in comparison to the Earth's behaviour. Some speakers and
audience members also emphasized the benefits of comparisons that include
Venus, a terrestrial planet whose aeronomy is understood better than that
of Mars, or Jupiter and Saturn, gas giant planets whose atmospheres are
dominated by hydrogen and helium and exhibit strikingly different
behaviour from Earth.

Michael Mendillo</a> (Boston University) began the workshop with an
introduction, explaining how the atmospheres of Earth and Mars are both
dominated by molecular, not atomic species, how both ionospheres are
dominated by molecular ions that are produced by charge exchange between
neutrals and photo-produced ions, how both ionospheres are double-peaked,
and how both ionospheres have lower boundaries near 100 km altitude. The
ionosphere, exobase, and ionopause regions on Mars span only a few hundred
kilometres, one-tenth of their range on Earth.

Jim Murphy (New Mexico State University) discussed thermospheric general
circulation models (GCMs) for Earth and Mars. Several different Martian
GCMs exist, all deriving from terrestrial GCMs. The many similarities
between the atmospheres of Earth and Mars make GCMs more robust on Mars
than on any other planet besides Earth. No ground-to-exosphere GCM exists
for Mars yet, which makes the upper and lower boundary conditions of any
GCM critically important and also impedes accurate modelling of vertically
propagating waves and tides. Since there are no measurements of winds in
the upper atmosphere of Mars, models play a key role in studies of
atmospheric dynamics.

Monica Angelats i Coll</a> (UCLA) discussed tides and gravity waves on Earth
and Mars. Mars has much more diurnal heating per unit atmospheric mass
than Earth, which generates strong migrating tides, topographic relief of
over 20 km, which generates many other tidal modes and waves, and no ozone
layer, which encourages vertical propagation of these disturbances.
Consequently tides and waves deliver large amounts of momentum and energy
to the martian upper atmosphere and perturb it greatly.

Rod Heelis (UT Dallas) discussed the measurements and observations
necessary to form a comprehensive picture of the aeronomy of Mars. They
are similar to those provided by the Dynamics Explorer mission for the
Earth over 20 years ago. Suitable instruments, such as an ion-neutral mass
spectrometer, a Fabry-Perot interferometer, a UV spectrometer, a retarding
potential analyzer, and a Langmuir probe, have flown on many spacecraft
and have a high technology readiness level. Heelis encouraged audience
members to attend an August 2004 Mars Aeronomy Workshop, organized by NASA
HQ, that will discuss specific opportunities for future spacecraft
missions that study martian aeronomy

Paul Withers</a> (Boston University) discussed how to start a research project
involving martian aeronomy. All NASA spacecraft data from Mars is freely
available at either <a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="cedarweb_aux">
http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/</a> or
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planets/marspage.html" target="cedarweb_aux">
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planets/marspage.html</a>. These websites
also have useful descriptions of past and future missions,
instrumentation, and personnel. General circulation model results are
available at either
<a href="http://data.engin.umich.edu/tgcm_planets_archive/thermo.html" target="cedarweb_aux">

<a href="http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars/access.html" target="cedarweb_aux">
http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars/access.html</a>. The most commonly used
reference book is "Mars", published by the University of Arizona Press in
1992 and edited by Kieffer et al. $3M of funding for Mars-related
research, including comparative aeronomy, is available from NASA's Mars
Data Analysis Program each year.

Geoff Crowley (SWRI) gave a brief presentation on the status of his Mars
GCM, which is under development. Several members of the audience discussed
comparative aeronomy research further with the workshop conveners during
the remainder of the CEDAR meeting. We are hopeful that this workshop has
catalysed several new research projects in this area that will be reported
at the next CEDAR meeting.
