In order to accommodate the schedule demands of this meeting, this workshop attempted to combine two 
views of one of the fundamental problems in modeling: understanding departures from the mean state of the 
ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere (ITM). We can approach the problem by looking at the response 
to the most extreme perturbations - superstorms - and addressing the question of whether we see "saturation"
in either the drivers or in the response. We must also have a thorough knowledge of the mean state and
the internal and external drivers that affect the ITM. 
<p>
Super storms focus on processes that become evident when the forcing on the system is extreme (i.e., saturation
of the polar cap potential, midlatitude great red auroras, oxygen auroras, changes in current systems,
changes in conductivity patterns, extreme ionospheric disturbances, etc.) but these same processes are 
obscured by other processes under milder conditions. The long term goal of the organizers is to investigate 
how elements of the global system interact, how nonlinearities develop, how feedbacks impact the global 
response, etc. From the equations, that govern the atmosphere (continuity, momentum and energy) it is 
readily apparent that thermospheric winds play the unifying role in coupling the thermosphere and the
ionosphere. To understand the dynamics we must understand the coupling between the thermosphere and
ionosphere during quiet to disturbed conditions, and the problems with modeling and predicting this
environment. 
<p>
The session was very well attended, especially for a session on the last day of CEDAR, with an audience of 
about 100 people. There were several short presentations during the first part of the workshop which focused 
on the superstorm response. In the second part of the session, the emphasis was on delineating the issues
of the neutral winds and dynamics.

At the end of the workshop we took an informal poll of the audience: when asked for a show of 
interest in a multi-day elaboration of this workshop, the response was overwhelmingly
positive. The conveners are working toward planning a multi-day workshop on storms and
circulation in the ITM.  Interested parties are asked to contact one of the conveners.
