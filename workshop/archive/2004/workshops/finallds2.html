The goal of this workshop was to bring the community together to design a series of collaborative experiments
using GPS data.  Specifically with the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) coming
on line, we have an opportunity to collect background information in the dynamic polar region.  There also 
exist opportunities to plan investigations combining GPS data with measurements from the Communication/
Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS) satellite instrumentation.  In this workshop, we attempted to 
identify and discuss the scientific areas such as the irregularities and spatial gradients of the equatorial 
anomaly and sub-auroral trough region that may be investigated with the combination of various types of 
instruments.
<p>
The workshop began with introductions demonstrating the purpose and capabilities of AMISR and C/NOFS.  
These presentations were followed with a description of GPS capabilities for ionospheric characterization 
and how GPS has been combined with other instruments.  These presentations generated much discussion 
on the upcoming instrumentation and on the overall usefulness of GPS in development and experimentation.
<p>
The first presentation on the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) was given by Rick Doe 
of SRI.  AMISR will be constructed in two stages over the next four years. The first face will be constructed 
in Poker Flat, Alaska. A subsection of AMISR, an eight-panel radar, will be deployed at the Jicamarca Radio 
Observatory (JRO) in 2004. The remaining two faces will be built in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada.
Subsequent locations will be determined by a scientific advisory panel.
<p>
The AMISR faces will initially be pointed to sense the polar cap and auroral regions with some possibility of 
pointing equatorward to cover sub-auroral areas.  In its high latitude position, AMISR is capable of monitoring
the global polar convection pattern, polar cap arc, electrodynamics and F region patch structure and
evolution.  As was pointed out by Phil Erickson, the merging of GPS observations of storm enhanced density
(SED) and the tongue of ionization with AMISR observations will help explain and interpret some of the 
complex phenomena observed in the polar ionosphere.
<p>
The second formal presentation was made by Odile de la Beaujardiere on C/NOFS.  Odile initiated the
discussion with a summary of the C/NOFS mission to provide continuous global scintillation forecasts of
communication and navigation outages.  The mission will also enable an improved understanding of the
equatorial ionosphere and the scintillation triggers and inhibitors.  The C/NOFS satellite will be equipped 
with various instruments that include a GPS receiver.  Odile discussed efforts to complement the C/NOFS 
efforts with campaign data and data from various instruments.  These instruments will include ground based 
TEC and scintillation measurements made from various GPS receivers.  In particular, a network of TEC and 
scintillation receivers located along the west coast of South America have already been used to validate
the background models of C/NOFS and will be an integral part of validation of the impending measurements.
<p>
The last invited presentation was made by Tony Mannucci.  This presentation focused on the capabilities of 
GPS in ionospheric characterization.  Tony provided a brief review of what GPS measures - both on the 
ground and in space.  In many ways GPS data are complementary to other instruments.  Tony showed
examples of how GPS TEC measurements in the equatorial region were complementary to observations from the
Julia radar at Jicamarca, how GPS TEC measurements were complementary to optical measurements in 
Puerto Rico and Hawaii, and how GPS scintillation measurements tracked magnetometer readings at the 
Bear Lake Observatory.  GPS mapping techniques have provided a new visualization tool to observe the 
complex dynamics of storm-time TEC.  GPS TEC measurements and their proxies are being successfully 
incorporated into next generation data assimilation models for the ionosphere. GPS has the advantage that it 
is continuously available, it can provide global and regional coverage, and it is sensitive to both small and 
large-scale plasma structure.  Integrating GPS measurements into multi-instrument campaigns will lead to
increased understanding of the complex physical processes in the high, mid, and low latitude ionosphere. 
<p>
Much interest was generated from the workshop participants during these presentations.  There were numerous
comments and questions that revealed a general interest in elevating GPS for scientific investigations
and collaborations with other instruments.  
<p>
The formal presentations were followed by short presentations.  Gary Bust discussed an open source GPS 
tool kit that facilitates processing raw GPS data to obtain ionospheric electron content.  Larissa
Goncharenko illustrated the usefulness of combining GPS with ISR data.  John Makela talked about the
capability to measure the worldwide ionosphere by combining GPS with imagers.  John Foster made
recommendations for using GPS in the Global Plasma Structures Radar Experiment, a planned 2005 ISR 
Campaign day.  Tim Fuller-Rowell addressed the modeling aspect by showing the benefits of using
multi-instruments, including GPS, in regional ionospheric modeling.  Brent Ledvina described a promising
technique to estimate the ionospheric scattering altitude from GPS measurements made from three receivers.
Finally, J.Y. Liu showed how GPS signatures have great potential to detect earthquake epicenters.
<p>
Nearly 100 people attended this workshop.  Although we did not realize the goal of designing collaborative 
experiments using multi-instruments, we were successful in initiating communication between various 
groups and in generating interest in these possibilities among student participants.  Handouts were provided 
that described the basic GPS equations, information on processing techniques and problems, directions to 
data sources and relevant references.  Overall, the convenors of this workshop were encouraged by the level 
of participation and interest in this topic.
