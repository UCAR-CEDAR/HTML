The first workshop on Mid-Latitude Plasma Structuring (MLPS) was held
on Thursday afternoon. About 50
people attended. The convenors were Mike Ruohoniemi and Ray Greenwald of
JHU/APL and John Foster of Millstone Hill/Haystack Observatory. This
tutorial workshop introduced the electrodynamics of the mid-latitude
ionosphere as a specific study topic for CEDAR. Recent work has turned up
exciting results on the occurrence of irregularities, intense electric
fields, and the penetration of auroral effects. Observations with GPS are
giving dramatic views of the structuring and transport of ionospheric plasma
on global scales. Concern about the societal impact of ionospheric
disturbance at mid-latitudes is giving added impetus to this research.
Moreover, the characterization and understanding of variability in the
mid-latitude ionospheric has been recognized as a primary objective of the
upcoming NASA/LWS Ionosphere-Thermosphere Storm Probes mission. The workshop
was motivated by a desire to focus the attention of the CEDAR community on
these developments and to identify promising directions for research and
collaboration.

The invited speakers included Bob Robinson (NSF) and John Foster, who
reviewed the range of ionospheric effects at mid-latitudes. These
presentations related the perturbations to the penetration of high-latitude
sources and to the dynamics of the plasmasphere. Jan Sojka (USU) described
the inadequacy of the current modeling efforts to account for the impressive
TEC perturbations seen in the GPS observations and suggested that
elucidation of the critical physics in the mid-latitude region will require
extending the observations and modeling to the highest latitudes. Dave
Hysell (Cornell) showed new results on the structuring of sporadic E layers
and the sources of small-scale irregularities in plasma instabilities.
Sundanda Basu (Boston University) spoke to the impact of auroral disturbance
in causing scintillations and GPS effects during magnetospheric storms.
Larry Paxton (JHU/APL) presented results of effects in neutral winds and
densities seen by satellite, similar to the IMAGE and TIMED O/N2 changes during 1-4 Oct 2002
prepared by <a href="../abstracts/Zhang_Yongliang.html">Yongliang Zhang</a>.
During the brief presentations session, Mike
Ruohoniemi described a project to extend SuperDARN capabilities to
mid-latitudes with the construction of an HF radar at Wallops Island. Nick
Zabotin (NOAA) interpreted dynasonde observations of small-scale
irregularities in terms of plasma instabilities.

Many instructive comments were received from the audience in the course of
the presentations. A consensus emerged that the variety of new results and
the prospects for further discoveries points to a need to reprise MLPS at
future CEDAR meetings. The 2005 meeting at Santa Fe would be particularly
apt as it will be possible to engage GEM researchers in an expanded
discussion of the solar wind and magnetospheric drivers of mid-latitude
disturbance. Accordingly, we will propose to coordinate a session of MLPS
next year with the GEM M-I coupling campaign.
