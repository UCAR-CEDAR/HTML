This workshop allowed both invited and contributing presenters to informally discuss middle and upper 
atmospheric data assimilation techniques and their use in subsequent forecasting endeavors.  The overall 
goals of the workshop were to
<ol>
<li>raise awareness of the importance and application of such assimilation
and forecasting research in the mesospheric and thermospheric regionsw
<li>allow for a unique forum that such topics could be discussed
</ol>
The 8 AM Friday morning workshop was well attended with over 30
CEDAR researchers, and presentations were given by:


<ul>
<li>R. W. Schunk, L. Scherliess,
J. J. Sojka, D. C. Thompson;
	Ionospheric Data Assimilation and Forecasting Methods

<li>C. Minter,
	Neutral Composition Data Assimilation

<li>S. Eckermann,
	Development of Global Middle Atmosphere Forecasting 
Capabilities at the Naval Research Laboratory

<li>E.M. Dewan and R.H. Picard,
	On Forecasting Mesospheric Bores

<li>A. Gerrard,
	Middle Atmospheric Gravity Wave Forecasting Methods
</ul>



with shorter contributing presentations towards the end of the workshop by:


<ul>
<li>J. Meriwether,
	Global network of Fabry-Perot interferometers 
to measure thermospheric dynamics

<li>O. de la Beaujardiere,
	Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System

<li>L. Scherliess, R.W. Schunk,
J.J. Sojka, and D. C. Thompson;
	Ionospheric Data Assimilation Techniques
</ul>


<p>
It became apparent both during the workshop and throughout the preceding week of the CEDAR conference
that these particular topics are becoming ever more important in middle and upper atmospheric
research.  Our understanding of the synoptic nature of the atmospheric system increases dramatically when 
spatially limited observations are assimilated in real-time with physics-based models.  This data assimilation
product contributes to ongoing research in tidal, planetary, and gravity wave variability and to our ability
to predict ESF and space weather impacts.  It also naturally leads to the production of middle and upper
atmospheric forecasts which allows the scientific community to truly test their understanding of the
physical processes taking place.


<p>
Other than technical conclusions, the overall impressions surmised from the workshop include:
<ol>
<li>A large population of the CEDAR community is ready to progress/expand into a new phase of middle
and upper atmospheric research that involves real-time data assimilation and forecasting of the middle 
and upper atmosphere.  This involves a much closer working relationship between modelers, theoreticians
and experimentalists than currently exists.

<li>There is a desire to better organize and publicize such research topics.

<li>A number of forecasting efforts are currently underway which require real-time data products (e.g.,
thermospheric wind and temperature data into the GAIM model of R. Schunk, mesospheric wind data 
into the global gravity wave forecasts of A. Gerrard, etc.)

<li>There is interest in a 2-3 day workshop devoted entirely to these topics, where more time can be given
to the discussion and debate of current techniques and infrastructure.
</ol>
