The 2004 CEDAR student workshop, "Gear for Your Thesis," focused on introducing
students to basic understanding of some of the tools used in the community.  The
morning talks focused on lidar and its applications to remote sensing.  Alex Hassiotis 
(Penn State) provided an introductory talk, "Lidar for Dummies," covering the principles 
of how lidars work and what they can be used to measure.  Rich Collins (University of 
Alaska Fairbanks) followed with "The CEDAR Lidar Report, Thoughts for Students," in 
which he explored possible research opportunities for students looking for thesis projects.  
The afternoon sessions began with Jeff Baumgardner's (Boston University) talk, "Design 
Considerations for Monochromatic Imagers and Imaging Spectrographs," where students 
were exposed to the thought processes involved in constructing optical imagers.  Jon 
Makela (NRL) followed up with "Basic Imaging Techniques for Ionospheric Studies," in 
which he showed how all sky cameras impact upper atmosphere research.  The last third of 
the workshop highlighted the role of radars in CEDAR.  Mary McCready (SRI) gave an 
overview of all of the research opportunities available at Sondestrom in her talk, "Shop at 
the Sondestrom Facility - Quality Artic Gear for Your Thesis."  Finially, the keynote talk 
was presented by Ronald Woodman (Jicamarca).  His talk,
<a href="http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/workshop/tutorials/2004/woodman04.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
"Incoherent and Coherent Scatter Radars:  Jicamarca examples"</a>,
covered the basic techniques of coherent and incoherent scatter radars as well as
how they have impacted atmospheric research.  Thanks to the speakers and everyone who 
attended, the 2004 student workshop was a rousing success!
