<h2>PART I: Aeronomy research at the Upper Atmospheric Facilities</h2>

This workshop concerned aeronomy research at low and mid latitudes
conducted at Arecibo and Jicamarca using the incoherent scatter radars
and the adjoining instrument clusters. The workshop differed from
those held in past years in two major respects. First, the conveners
combined the two facilities into a single workshop and solicited
presentations identifying research problems that can best be addressed
using both facilities. Second, they held discussions pertaining to
facility news and programmatics to a minimum, maintaining a focus on
emerging problems in low latitude aeronomy and experiments designed to
pursue them.
<p>
A number of joint investigations are already taking place at Jicamarca
and Arecibo, including studies of the topside composition. Sixto
Gonzalez pointed out that such studies have been underway at Arecibo
for many years and have progressed to the point of validating
physics-based models, which have only recently been able to reproduce
the high helium ion abundances seen at midlatitudes at night during
solar minimum.  Fabiano Rodrigues presented new topside composition
results from Jicamarca, where a topside observing program has just
begun. All agreed that current empirical models of the topside are
inadequate and potentially misleading (e.g. for TEC
estimates). Another topic of common interest is meteor head echoes
which are being studied at both facilities by Diego Janches, who
pointed out the significance of being able to determine the bearing of
micrometeorites at Jicamarca using interferometry in estimating total
flux rates.
<p>
Some differences in the research programs at Arecibo and Jicamarca
necessarily arise from differences in the capabilities of the
radars. At Arecibo, observations of the photoelectron-enhanced plasma
line make it possible to distinguish between molecular ions in the
bottomside (Nestor Aponte) and to observe gravity-wave-induced plasma
density fluctuations with very high spatial and temporal resolution
(Frank Djuth). At Jicamarca, the ability to observe coherent
backscatter from field-aligned irregularities facilitates
investigations of gradient drift and Farley Buneman instabilities in
the E region
(<a href="../abstracts/Shume_Esayas.html">
Esayas Shume</a>, Meers Oppenheim) as well as of anomalous
"150 kilometer" echoes from the valley region (Jorge Chau). Plasma
instabilities and field aligned irregularities represent interesting
physics in their own right but also permit certain radar diagnostics
of ionospheric electric fields, plasma densities, and neutral winds
that would otherwise be impossible at Jicamarca.
<p>
A surprising aspect of the workshop was the emergence of gravity waves
as the dominant source of debate. Gravity waves are observed only
indirectly through their influence on the plasma dynamics and
structure. In addition to the Arecibo plasma line experiments, gravity
waves are clearly evident in the vector plasma drift profiles measured
routinely at Jicamarca, demonstrating their ability to polarize the
plasma. Mike Nichols discussed a spread F event observed at both
Arecibo and Jicamarca which was triggered by neutral forcing. Dave
Fritts then outlined a new experiment which will look for evidence
that gravity waves generated by convective storms in the troposphere
actually seed equatorial spread F events over Brazil. Such a seeding
mechanism, if it could be demonstrated, would represent an important
space weather effect. Another space weather effect studied at Arecibo
and Jicamarca is the equatorward propagation of storm-time TEC
perturbations evident in data from the South American GPS chain as
demonstrated by Cesar Valladares.
<p>
Optical instrumentation is an integral part of aeronomy research at
the two low-latitude facilities. Michael Faivre presented Fabry Perot
interferometer data showing clear signatures of the Midnight
Temperature Maximum (MTM) observed over Arecibo and
Jicamarca. Modelling this phenomenon has been challenging but provides
unique insight into the tidal forcing that must be present in the
lower thermosphere.  Jonathan Friedman later discussed the collocation
of sporadic layers and atomic layers observed over Arecibo.  The
assembled group looked forward to new optical instrumentation
scheduled for deployment in Puerto Rico and South America.

<h2>Part II: Storm-time Ionospheric Disturbance in the Low Latitudes</h2>



The second part of the workshop focused on ionospheric disturbances in the low-latitude region during
magnetic storms. The main drivers of the ionospheric disturbance in the low-latitude region are storm-time
electric fields, neutral winds, and thermospheric composition disturbance (TCD). The goal of this workshop was
to put together the observations and model simulations to distinguish their contributions to the ionospheric 
disturbance. The presentations in this workshop demonstrated the importance of storm-induced electric 
fields as drivers of ionospheric disturbances in the low-latitude region. They modify the location and 
strength of the EIA, create a deep equatorial ionization trough, suppress or promote the equatorial bubble 
activity depending on when they occur, and also affect the equatorward expansion of the TCD. The TCD is 
known as a primarily plasma depletion mechanism in the high- and middle-latitudes during storm time but 
its effect has been ignored in the low-latitude region. This workshop may be the first workshop that provided 
an opportunity for a full discussion of the TCD effect on the low-latitude ionosphere. The model simulations 
and observations provided clear evidence of the expansion of the TCD from the high latitudes to equatorial 
region and the equatorial plasma depletions by the TCD. This workshop stimulated the study of the TCD 
contribution to storm-time effects in the low-latitude ionosphere. The important questions raised in this 
workshop are:
<ol>
<li>Could we distinguish the effects of the direct penetration and dynamo electric fields
<li>What are the suppression and promotion mechanisms of the bubble activity during storm time
<li>Could the TCD be the plasma depletion mechanism in the equatorial region?
</ol>
This workshop suggested some clues to
these questions and also motivated a new approach to the phenomena in the low-latitude ionosphere. The 
future challenges are to provide solid evidence that supports the proposed new ideas.

Bela Fejer gave an excellent overview of the penetration and dynamo electric fields that are the main drivers 
of ionospheric disturbances during storm times. Jonathan Makela presented observations of the change in 
zonal plasma drift velocity and F-layer height during storm time from ground-based optical measurements 
and discussed the effects of the storm-time electric field on equatorial plasma bubble activity. Naomi 
Maruyama conducted Coupled Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Plasmasphere-Electrodynamics (CTIPe) model 
simulations and showed that the direct penetration electric field can modify the ionospheric dynamo by 
changing the conductivity and neutral wind. Sid Henderson investigated the morphology of the nighttime 
Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) by using OI 135.6-nm disk-scan data from TIMED/GUVI and showed 
that the strength of storm-time ionospheric disturbances is variable with season and longitude. Trevor
Garner investigated the location and strength of the EIA during the storm of October 30-31, 2003 by using the
Ionospheric Data Assimilation Three Dimensional (IDA3D) Algorithm and showed the formation of deeper 
equatorial ionization trough and greater separation of the EIA than predicted by climatological models. 
Geoff Crowley gave a tutorial on ionosphere-thermosphere coupling effects and also presented model
simulation results that showed the suppression of the daytime oxygen density in the low-latitude region during
big storms. Yongliang Zhang investigated thermospheric composition disturbance (TCD) by using optical 
measurements from the TIMED/GUVI and IMAGE/SI-13 instruments and showed the expansion of the 
TCD from the high latitudes to the equatorial region. Pallamraju Duggirala presented observations of large 
enhancements in OI 630.0-nm emissions during the daytime in Chile during the magnetic storm of November
6, 2001 and attributed this phenomenon to the enhancement of neutral density produced by the equatorward
propagation of neutrals. Hyosub Kil investigated the formation of large equatorial plasma depletions
during big magnetic storms and proposed that they are produced by the enhanced chemical plasma loss in 
the bubbles caused by the TCD.
