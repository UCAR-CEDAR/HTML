The lidar technical session was called in order to prompt an open discussion amongst the lidar 
community and other interested members of the CEDAR community as to what technologies 
should be brought to bear to resolve the issues presented in the CEDAR lidar community
self-assessment report.  These issues were both specifically science, as well as how to support
upcoming facilities such as AMISR and HIAPER.  There were about 30 attendees, with about 10
students.  With the stage set by the morning workshop roundtable on science issues for future
CEDAR lidars, the presently developed techniques for Doppler-resonance lidar were presented.

<a href="../abstracts/Hoeffner_Josef.html">
Josef Hoeffner</a> of the Leibniz Institute for Atmospheric Physics, Germany, presented the technique
behind and evolution of the 15-year old mobile IAP lidar.  His talk was entitled: A solid state
scanning iron/potassium lidar for precise temperature and vertical wind measurements.  He
demonstrated how alexandrite lasers can be reliable transmitters for lidar applications.  He demonstrated
how the IAP alexandrite laser operates reliably over long periods with near-ideal spectral output.  
Josef showed the system as applied to K and Fe studies of mesospheric temperatures and line-of-sight
winds.  Finally, he demonstrated that, with optimized present-day technology, there is little
statistical difference in temperature and wind measurements made by a solid-state laser-based K 
and Fe lidar, and those of Na lidars.

C. Y. (Joe) She of Colorado State University, presented a talk entitled: Narrowband sodium lidar 
transmitter: present performance and future improvements.  He began with the history of the CSU 
Na lidar development and demonstrated its capabilities.  Included were examples of the data quality
for the full spectrum observing conditions, including day and night for seasons of maximum
and minimum Na density.  Joe also showed how this lidar, often described as too complex to be 
broadly applicable, operates continuously and trouble-free over periods of many days; and he 
posed the question: Can a system too difficult to operate be robust at the same time?  He described 
the fruits of his own efforts to enhance the laser by introducing solid state technology, and he
concluded by showing the next stage of upgrades to the "Gold Standard" of resonance lidars, by
making it fully solid-state, and thus applicable to mobile and remote platforms.

Dr. Xinzhao Chu of University of Illinois presented the technical aspects of the pre-proposal White 
Paper she co-authored, in a talk entitled: 3-Frequency Fe/Rayleigh Temperature Lidar for Middle 
Atmosphere Observations from Research Aircraft and Remote Sites.  Xinzhao's talk presented a 
next-generation Rayleigh-plus-resonance lidar.  Improvements to alexandrite lasers in recent years 
make it an attractive light source not only for the K and Fe lidars, which are already in use, but also 
a simultaneous Fe resonance and Rayleigh temperature lidar.  She pointed out that the simplicity, 
stability and durability of the system makes it attractive to mobile applications, in particular
operation on board the new NCAR Hiaper aircraft.

We then changed gears, and Gary Swenson, University of Illinois, presented "Technologies evolving
for Rayleigh lidar."  Gary showed developing laser technologies that could be applied to
Rayleigh lidar.  It is clear that solid-state (diode) laser technologies, coupled with fiber amplifiers,
portend a great opportunity.  Still, the lack of a broad market for the type of laser appropriate for 
lidar still make these lasers "custom" products.

Finally, Biff Williams, Colorado State, presented two promising technologies, one to extend the 
capabilities of existing Na and K lidars to making upper tropospheric and stratospheric wind
measurements, and a second to increase receiver apertures in a way that is economical and transportable.
In the first technology, a magneto-optical filter can extend the application of resonance lidar,
in particular, for K and Na lidars, to make wind, temperature, and aerosol measurements in the
troposphere to mid-stratosphere.  These would occur simultaneously with the standard mesospheric
W/T measurements.  The second technology presented was an economical and transportable
multiple-mirrored method for building a 3-m class telescope.
<p>
It is clear that there is no obvious "winner" for the next generation of resonance lidar transmitter, 
as Na, Fe, and K lidars each have their advantages and disadvantages.  The tradeoffs and technical 
issues generated a lively discussion and helped us all to be aware of the fact that, though there is no 
panacea for middle atmospheric lidar, there is a range of choice of technologies that produce
comparable results.  Given the issues, the community has decided to hold a retreat in late September to
finally hash them out and hopefully emerge united with a proposal for the next Doppler resonance 
lidar.
