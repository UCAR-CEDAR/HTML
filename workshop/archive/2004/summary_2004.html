<a name="SUM"><h3>Summary of the 2004 CEDAR Workshop</h3></a>

<p>
The CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions)
Workshop for 2004 was held at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
<p>
A total of 316 persons from 70 institutions, 17 outside the
United States and Puerto Rico, attended the 2004 CEDAR Workshop.
This year, 121 students and recent grads came from 26 universities and 5
research labs, including Canada (4), Japan (4), the United Kingdom (1),
France (1), Korea (1), Brazil (1) and Columbia (1).  The total attendance
was down from 356 in 2003, with 12 less students and 19 less Colorado locals.
<p>
The Student Workshop on Sunday organized by the new CEDAR student representative
Stanley Briczinski of the Pennsylvania State University looked at
'Instrumentation - Gear for Your Thesis'.  There were 6 speakers,
one of whom, Alexander Hassiotis, was a student from Penn State speaking
on 'LIDAR for Dummies'.
The Keynote Speaker was Ron Woodman, who gave a talk on 'Incoherent and
Coherent Scatter Radars:  Jicamarca Examples' which was video-taped and
is also on-line in .pdf form (click on 'Tutorials').
Stan will continue next year in his second year as student representative,
joined by Carlos Martinis of Boston University.
<p>
The CEDAR Prize Lecture was given by Maura Hagan of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.  She gave a good overview of 'Tidal Coupling in the
Earth's Atmosphere'.
The 4 tutorial speakers were Craig Heinselman of SRI International (AMISR),
Chet Gardner of the University of Illinois (Lidar winds and temperatures),w
Dave Hysell of Cornell University ('AMISR Contributions to Equatorial Aeronomy'),
and Paul Bernhardt of the Naval Research Laboratory (chemical release studies).
All of these talks are available as .pdf files on the web (click on 'Tutorials')
and are also on video tape.
Please contact Barbara Emery (emery@ucar.edu, HAO/NCAR, PO Box 3000,
Boulder CO 80307) if interested in obtaining hard copies and/or videos.
<p>
There were 25 workshops, which was the same number as last year, in spite
of having 2 hours less of workshop time and combining several workshops
together.  The specific workshops are described elsewhere in this issue.
<p>
There were 6 CEDAR and related post-doc reports given by
Rebecca Bishop of Clemson, James Boulter of SRI, Aimee Merkel of NCAR,
Weilin Pan of SRI, Alok Taori of USU, and Paul Withers of BU.
There were also about 15 programmatic talks during the plenary sessions,
which were about 5 hours shorter than most years.
<p>
We enjoyed two late afternoon poster/reception sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday,
where all posters were up the entire time.  We had 83 posters presented
on Tuesday and 50 on Wednesday, for a total of 133.  This is a record
number of posters, exceeding the number of 118 set last year.
The poster lighting was a little low due to the presence of beautiful
(but opaque) blue draperies that were hung on the walls and ceiling in
preparation for the masked Opera Gala on Thursday.  The lighting was
better for the middle atmosphere topics presented on Wednesday!
<p>
We had 64 student posters under competition, and 14 other student posters for
a record number of 78 student posters.  The previous record was 64 student
posters in 1994.  Congratulations to our CEDAR students!
There were two student winners in the poster competition,
Ningyu Liu of the Pennsylvania State University and Melissa Meyer
of the University of Washington.  There were also three honorable mentions:
Xiaohua Fang of the University of Michigan, Patrick Roddy of the University
of Texas at Dallas, and Jing Tang of the University of Illinois.  They
all received prizes of books, and will get achievement certificates to
hang on their walls!
<p>
There were many extra-curricular activities for the 2004 CEDAR Workshop.
We took a 56-passenger bus from Fort Collins, Colorado to Santa Fe with
12 passengers coming down from Colorado.  This bus was then used to
take students to the student bowling social at Silva Lanes on Sunday
evening, and was also used as transportation for the tours arranged
for us and our families by Santa Fe Destinations.  We had two tours offered:
one to the Bradbury Science Museum at Los Alamos and to the
ancient Pueblo ruins at Bandelier National Monument, and the
second to La Cieneguilla Petroglyphs.  The tours were well done
and enjoyable, but except for Friday, were scheduled during workshops
or poster sessions!
<p>
Santa Fe Destinations also designed a petroglyph CEDAR T-shirt for us to
commemorate the meeting.  There are still 9 shirts left over (5 long sleeved,
4 short sleeved, most XL with one 2XL and one L).
Please contact Barbara Emery (emery@ucar.edu) if interested in a shirt.
<p>
The joint 2005 CEDAR-GEM Workshop will take place at the Eldorado and the
La Fonda Hotels in Santa Fe, New Mexico June 26 - July 1.  A joint CEDAR-GEM
committee put together by Josh Semeter, our CEDAR-GEM coordinator,
will work on the science overlap, community acitivities, and logistics
to have a great joint experience.
