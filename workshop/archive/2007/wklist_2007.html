CEDAR Student Workshop:
Theme - Winds in the Upper Atmosphere:  Physics, Observations, and Empirical Models
with conveners Romina Nikoukar and Mike Nicolls
<p><b>0855-1600 Sunday 24 June Zia</b>
<a href="/workshop/archive/2007/agenda_2007.html" target="cedarweb_aux">
Agenda</a>
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
This year's Student Workshop was entitled "Winds in the Upper Atmosphere - Physics, Observations, and Empirical Models".  The basic idea was to target CEDAR newcomers and provide them with a broad overview of various elements that make CEDAR such a multi- disciplinary field. We chose neutral winds as the focal theme since they play a significant role in the electrodynamics of the upper atmosphere. Neutral winds are strongly linked to plasma processes and they are difficult to measure; as such, they remain an active topic of research.
<p>
The workshop started with two keynote speeches in the morning. Jeff  
Forbes (University of Colorado) delivered the first keynote speech entitled
<a href="/workshop/tutorials/2007/forbes_07.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
"Dynamics of Thermosphere"</a> which provided an overview of the neutral dynamics of the upper atmosphere. The second keynote speech was given by Art Richmond (National Center for Atmospheric Research) and was entitled
<a href="/workshop/tutorials/2007/richmond_07.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
"Neutral Winds and Their Role in Ionospheric Electrodynamics"</a>. The presentation primarily focused on ion-neutral interactions, the ionospheric wind dynamo, and thermospheric-ionospheric coupling.
<p>
The afternoon workshop started with a series of tutorials on wind measurement methodologies. In particular, presentations were given on
<a href="/workshop/archive/2007/presentations/larsen_stud07.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Rocket-based measurements</a> (Miguel Larsen from Clemson University),
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/d/d5/PALO_CEDAR_meteor_radar.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Meteor radar wind experiments</a> (Scott Palo from University of Colorado),
<a href="/workshop/archive/2007/presentations/gardner_winds_07.pdf">

<a href="/workshop/archive/2007/presentations/meriwether_stud07.pdf">
Fabry-Perot wind measurements</a> (John Meriwether from Clemson University). The main motivation behind these talks was to introduce students to different instruments, measurement techniques, and data as well as their relationship to the physics of different regions. The final tutorial of the Student Workshop, devoted to Neutral wind models, was provided by John Emmert (Naval Research Laboratory). Empirical wind models, in particular the Horizontal Wind Model, were the main focus of the presentation, although physics-based models were also discussed.

<br>
In this workshop Peter Fiske will present a thorough and practical  
overview to the process of career planning and job hunting in today's  
job market, from the perspective of a young scientist. He will cover  
specific steps that young scientists can take to broaden their  
horizons, strengthen their skills, and present their best face to  
potential employers. An important part of this is the realization  
that most young scientists possess a range of valuable "transferable  
skills" that are highly sought after by employers in and out of  
science. He will also cover all the specifics of job hunting,  
including informational interviewing, building your network,  
developing a compelling CV and resume, cover letters, interviewing,  
and more. With each topic he will discuss the particular challenges  
and opportunities faced by those with an advanced degree in science.  
It is a workshop up-beat in tone and positive in outlook. Students  
and young scientists are encouraged to attend.

Meteors and the upper atmosphere
with conveners Lars Dyrud and Sigrid Close
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1600 (3 hr) Monday 25 June Anasazi North</b>
<br>
Every year approximately 100,000 tons of meteoric material impacts Earth's
atmosphere near 100 km altitude.  However, many questions remain on this
meteor mass and energy flux and the impact of this flux on upper atmospheric
chemistry and ionization.  For example, global yearly mass flux estimates
are not constrained to within an order of magnitude.  Of particular
importance to the CEDAR community is that meteors account for all of the
dust, metal neutral and ionized particles in the upper atmosphere (since
there is no convection or diffusion of atoms or particles of this size from
the ground all the way to 100 km).  Further, meteoric dust is also thought
to provide the condensation nuclei for polar mesospheric clouds PMC (high
altitude clouds near 80 km), which is the focuses of a current NASA mission
(AIM).  Yet it remains unclear whether variability in meteor flux generates
variability in PMC occurrence.  Additionally, CEDAR researchers have used
radar reflections from meteor trails to remotely sense winds and
temperatures near the mesopause (a very difficult place to take
meausurements, too high for lidar to low for fabry-perot measurements).
With some success for winds but little success for temperatures.  To address
these issues, we invite presentations on the physics of meteors and their
interaction with the atmosphere and ionosphere.  Specific discussion is
encouraged on the observation of meteors with NSF and CEDAR supported
facilities, or the theoretical interpretation of such observations.  We
encourage contributions of research attempting to better understand meteors
or general aeronomy via meteor observations, including upper atmospheric
chemistry and metal layers.  We also invite presentations of radar, Lidar
and optical observations.  Theoretical studies or simulations of the meteors
and meteor trail interactions with the atmosphere/ionosphere are also
invited.  
<p>
It is expected that much discussion and presentations during this workshop
will center on large radar observations of meteors including observations
from Arecibo, Jicamarca, and AMISR, as CEDAR researchers have made serious
contributions to the field of meteor science and meteor aeronomy using these
radars over the past decade.

Short period gravity waves and their effects in the MLT region
with conveners Jonathan B. Snively, Tai-Yin Huang, and Michael J. Taylor
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Monday 25 June Zia</b>
<br>
This workshop will focus on short-period gravity waves (<30 min period) in
the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere (MLT) at all latitudes, including new
theoretical, numerical, and observational results.  Short-period gravity
waves comprise a significant fraction of wave energy at MLT heights.
However, some challenges exist in the study of such short-period waves.
Their excitation and propagation are strongly dependent on larger scale
atmospheric structure, dynamics, and variability at all altitudes.
Furthermore, their small scale size generally prohibits direct simulation in
large-scale models, limiting our ability to study them numerically under
realistic conditions.  Due to these challenges, it is necessary to
understand and quantify short-period gravity wave processes and effects in
the MLT via observation and detailed numerical or theoretical modeling.  It
is also necessary to understand gravity wave interactions with observable
atmospheric processes, an example being the modulation of nighttime airglow
chemistry by gravity waves.
<p>
Talks will pertain broadly to short-period gravity waves in the MLT, and the
techniques by which they are observed.  Specific topics may include
short-period gravity wave excitation, propagation, ducting, dissipation,
breaking, and nonlinearity in the MLT.  Gravity wave effects on chemistry,
modulation of airglow layers, and transport/deposition of energy and
momentum are also of particular interest.
<p>
The workshop is organized as a series of short talks, beginning with general
overviews of the present state of research, and progressing to contributed
short presentations of ~10 min (~5 slides).  Talks will focus on new
research and recently-published results, while maintaining a format which is
friendly to a broad audience.  Student contributions are welcome and
encouraged.  Additional discussion time of 30 minutes will be allotted
following the talks.  Anyone interested to contribute a talk should contact
Jonathan Snively by email (jbs231@psu.edu) as soon as convenient.
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
Organized with the goal of reviewing new results from recent years, this workshop consisted of five very interesting presentations on gravity waves and their effects in the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere (MLT).  Focus was placed on the behavior and effects of gravity waves of relatively small scale, and short period.  These talks, given by David Fritts, Gary Swenson, Richard Walterscheid, Robert Schunk, and Yonghui Yu, covered a range of relevant topics, including numerical and theoretical modeling, calculation of wave properties and effects from airglow data, effects of acoustic and evanescent waves, wave influence on the ionosphere, and gravity wave ducting, respectively.  
<p>
Gravity waves comprise a significant fraction of wave energy and momentum at MLT altitudes.  Their excitation and propagation are strongly dependent on the larger scale atmospheric structure, dynamics, and variability at all altitudes.  Their momentum and energy flux contributions are controlled by these large-scale dynamics, and likewise influence these dynamics.  Short-period gravity wave processes and effects are studied principally at local scales, via all-sky airglow imaging, and numerical and theoretical modeling.   This provides a detailed local-scale perspective, from which we can estimate global-scale effects.  Similarly, three of the presentations focused on numerical model results, one focused on analysis of airglow data, and one on the integration of gravity wave forcing with ionospheric models.
<p>
Dr. Fritts presented "High-frequency gravity wave propagation and dissipation in the MLT", and discussed high-resolution numerical results for three-dimensional simulations of breaking gravity waves.  It was noted that wave instability and breakdown could occur even below convective instability, generating both turbulence and secondary wave motions. 
<p>
Dr. Swenson presented "Gravity waves and vertical wavelength from airglow phase", describing a model for the calculation of gravity wave vertical wavelength, damping rates, and momentum flux.  Rather than relying on a single airglow layer at one altitude, this approach uses multi-layer image data and chemistry models to determine vertical structure.  
<p>
Dr. Walterscheid presented "Acoustic waves and acoustic wave processes in the lower thermosphere", on localized ionospheric heating by dissipation of vertically propagating acoustic waves.  Acoustic waves may be excited at lower altitudes by turbulent flow over mountains, and propagate vertically to produce hotspots as they dissipate.  He also presented on the importance of wind and thermal structure in providing strong ducts for large-magnitude "bore" waves.  
<p>
Dr. Schunk presented "A Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Plasmasphere data assimilation model component for a seamless ocean-atmosphere model".  He discussed the use of global-scale weather model data with ionospheric models, to improve ionospheric forecasts with the use of realistic lower-atmospheric forcing.  
<p>
Dr. Yu presented "Ducted gravity waves simulated with their energy flux", and reported numerical simulation results for a spectrum of ducted gravity waves, propagating within model temperature and wind profiles.  The vertical energy flux for non-ideally ducted wave packets is found to be periodic, as wave energy propagates between the upper and lower duct boundaries. 
<p>
We are very much indebted to the speakers, and to the audience, for making this a productive and interesting workshop.  Although we opted to eliminate the scheduled discussion time, allowing for longer talks and additional questions, we will look forward to an active panel discussion during the 2008 Workshop.

Equatorial ionospheric challenges and the C/NOFS mission
with conveners Odile de La Beaujardiere, Cheryl Huang, David Hysell, Michael Kelley,
Robert Pfaff, Jorge Chau, and John Retterer
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Monday 25 June Sunset</b>
<br>
This workshop will address the challenges in forecasting the equatorial ionosphere and irregularities within.  The discussions will be related but not limited to the C/NOFS (Communication and Navigation Outage Forecast System) mission. 
<p>
C/NOFS is a satellite mission dedicated to forecasting ionospheric densities, irregularities and scintillation.  It will be launched in 2005, in a 13 degrees inclination, 710 x 375 km orbit.  Its instruments will provide plasma parameters, electric & magnetic fields (AC and DC), density fluctuations, and neutral wind.  It will also have a GPS receiver, and an RF beacon.  Ground-based instruments and models, and space weather products are an integral part of the mission. 
<p>
The purpose of this workshop is to:
<ul>
<li>Address the main difficulties in forecasting the equatorial ionospheric behaviors
<li>Define collaborative projects that involve ground and space measurements
<li>Report on CNOFS validation plans and accomplishments
</ul>

Poker Flat AMISR: The first six months
with conveners Craig Heinselman and Mike Nicolls
</h4>
<p><b>0930-1130 Tuesday 26 June Anasazi South</b>
<br>
The Poker Flat AMISR has been operating throughout 2007 in support of  
rocket campaigns (January-February) and normal user operations  
(beginning March 2007).  By the time of the CEDAR workshop, it is  
anticipated that AMISR will have operated 960 hours in support of 24  
individual experiments under 26 different researchers.  Additionally,  
the ISR will have operated 2130 hours in a low-duty cycle mode for  
IPY support.  The objective of this workshop is to highlight the  
science targeted in the first six months and to present some of the  
first results.  Presentations will be solicited from the first AMISR  
users.  User experiments have included support for several multi-day  
World Day runs, several meteor runs, joint experiments with the HIPAS  
HF Facility, optical campaigns, interferometry experiments,  
coordinated observations with GeoTAIL, THEMIS and SSUSI, Joule  
heating experiments, gravity wave momentum flux experiments, and  
others.  The first experiments have led to the development of many  
AMISR observational configurations and analysis tools designed to  
compute products such as the electric field and E-region neutral wind  
vectors, in addition to standard incoherent scatter products (e.g.,  
temperatures and densities).  AMISR operations and planning will be  
reviewed in the workshop.  Future planned experiments and science  
goals, with both the Poker Flat and the Resolute Bay AMISRs, are also  
open areas of discussion.

Data assimilation in space sciences: Methods and results
with convener Mihail Codrescu
</h4>
<p><b>0930-1130 and 1300-1500 Tuesday 26 June Sunset</b>
<br>
Data assimilation is an integral part of any modern terrestrial weather prediction system. 
<p>
Even historical weather research uses data assimilation. The only debate left today is about what methods are best and how to implement them in different situations. In space sciences we are in the beginning of implementing data assimilation methods but rapid progress is being made and the first results from an operational implementation of a data assimilation scheme are already available. In this session we plan to review the state of data assimilation in space sciences and to present the latest results. Papers on the any aspects of data assimilation are welcome.

The Poker Flat 2007 Winter Campaign
with conveners Miguel Larsen, John Craven, and Craig Heinselman
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Tuesday 26 June Anasazi South</b>
<br>
In January and February 2007, a total of ten sounding rockets were launched from Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska.  This was an unusually large number of launches, in part to take advantage of the new measurement capabilities provided by the AMISR radar, which was recently installed at Poker Flat.  The campaign represents the first extended operation of the new incoherent scatter radar instrumentation at that site.  A number of other radar and optical instruments were also operated during the campaign.  The rocket experiments had a variety of objectives, but common themes were investigations of Joule heating, neutral circulation, and small-scale structure in the plasma and neutral flow.  The campaign provided an exceptionally detailed view of the neutral dynamics, electrodynamics, and plasma physics of the high-latitude thermosphere and ionosphere.  The workshop will deal primarily with the measurements obtained during the 2007 campaign, although other measurements or results that are relevant to the objectives of the campaign will also be included, as appropriate.

</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Tuesday 26 June Anasazi North for videocon with Arecibo and 1300-1500 Thursday 28 June Anasazi South</b>
<br>
There will be a videocon starting at 1 PM for about 1 hour in length on Tuesday
with Arecibo Observatory for a town hall meeting of visiting NSF managers and
Observatory staff related to the astronomy senior review.  This review recommended
a two-stage reduction in funding for the astronomical activities at Arecibo Observatory
from $10.5 million per year to $8 million and finally to $4 million.  How can the
Observatory continue to run with only $4 million per year for astronomical activities?
The videocon will explore all possible options.
<p>
The Thursday workshop will begin with a 40 minute discussion of the status
of the Arecibo Observatory/NAIC in light of the recent NSF
astronomy senior review and the Tuesday videocon.
Mike  Sulzer will say a few words about the new HF facility.
We will then proceed to hearing some highlights from the past year from some

with conveners Xinzhao Chu, Joe She, and Gary Swenson
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Tuesday 26 June Zia with internet</b>
<br>
      Resonance and Rayleigh lidars have the unique capability to provide high-resolution, range-resolved measurements of fundamental atmospheric parameters in the middle and upper atmosphere. These lidar measurements have made great scientific contributions to the CEDAR and Aeronomy community on dynamics, structure, composition, chemistry, microphysics, inter-hemispheric difference, and global trend, etc. Supported by NSF, a Consortium of Resonance and Rayleigh Lidars (CRRL) has been established in August 2006, and a lidar Consortium Technology Center (CTC) within CRRL is being developed in Boulder, Colorado. Through collective effort of CRRL and CEDAR community, our goals are to ensure each lidar group reaching the highest technology potential with maximum science return, to advance lidar technology to the next generation and extended measurement range, to reach out to the CEDAR community to increase the usage of lidars and lidar data, and to train next-generation lidar researchers. 
<p>
      This workshop will focus on the CEDAR lidar technology. It will provide an overview of the current status of wind and temperature lidar technology and measurement capability, present the recent technology improvements for transmitter and receiver, and explore the new technology for extending lidar detection to the thermosphere and for measuring wind and temperature from ground to the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. We will also discuss the CRRL web page and the proposed lidar school.

<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
This is the first lidar technology workshop hosted by the newly established lidar Consortium Technology Center (CTC) under the Consortium of Resonance and Rayleigh Lidars (CRRL), supported by the National Science Foundation. The workshop was structured to provide (1) an overview of the current status of Na (and K) lidars for MLT temperature and wind measurements, (2) recent improvements of Na and K Doppler lidars, and (3) technology exploration for extending lidar detection range. The workshop also discussed the CTC activities and how it will engage the CEDAR community. 
<p>
The CTC director, Dr. Xinzhao Chu (CU), opened the workshop with an introduction of CEDAR lidar technology to the broad audience. She introduced the physical picture, basic configuration, and arrangement of lidar remote sensing, and then summarized the physical processes utilized in various types of lidars and the physical quantities to be measured by each type of lidar. She reviewed the temperature lidars: Doppler, Boltzmann, integration, and DIAL techniques, and the wind lidars: Doppler wind, direct motion detection, and geostrophic wind techniques. The direct detection Doppler lidar (DDL) has developed into many types, e.g., resonance fluorescence DDL, fringe imaging DDL, scanning FPI DDL, FPI edge-filter DDL, atomic and molecular absorption line edge filter DDL. By introducing so many exciting technologies, she hoped to attract more students and young scientists to the field.
<p>
Dr. Chiao-Yao She (CSU), one of the pioneers in Na wind/temperature lidar, gave the keynote lecture of this workshop - a comprehensive review of the Na and K Doppler lidar technologies, measurement capabilities, and scientific achievements. Currently, three Na and two K lidars are being deployed by the CRRL groups, the Arecibo Observatory, and the Leibniz Institute for Atmospheric Physics (IAP) to collect crucial data for the middle and upper atmosphere study. Dr. She's talk not only provided students the fundamental knowledge of Na and K spectroscopy and lidar technology, but also clearly stated where we stand, providing a foundation for the CEDAR lidar community to move forward.
<p>
Following this, three speakers talked about the improvements and innovations being made to the resonance fluorescence (Na, K, Fe) Doppler lidars. Dr. Wentao Huang (CU) presented the novel high-resolution Doppler-free spectroscopy being studied at CTC in Boulder, and introduced several new ideas for laser frequency locking using the spectroscopy.
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/5/54/CEDAR_Liu_UIUCLidar.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Dr. Alan Liu (UIUC)</a> presented the very good progresses made by the UIUC group for high efficiency receiver for the Na wind and temperature lidar, and the initial data collected by this lidar at Urbana. Dr. Josef Hoeffner (IAP) presented some amazing results obtained by the IAP scanning K and Fe Doppler lidars. On both lidars, he emphasized how to achieve high accuracy, i.e., un-biased measurements. He demonstrated the superb daytime measurement capability, especially for the scanning Fe Doppler lidar operating at 386 nm with three highly stable Fabry-Perot etalons in the receiver and very small field of view (50 mrad). He also reported Doppler wind measurements in the lower atmosphere with the Fe Doppler lidar.
<p>
In the topic of extending lidar detection range, Dr. Rich Collins (UAF) introduced the N2+ lidar being developed at Poker Flat. Chad Carlson, a graduate student of UIUC, presented the lab test results of a Helium Doppler lidar. His initial results are very promising for making a cw-laser-based imaging lidar to measure the wind and temperature in the thermosphere. Dr. Andrew Gerrard (NJIT) reported a spectrally scanning receiver for middle and lower atmospheric wind measurements.
<p>
In the last part of the workshop, Paloma Farias and Johannes Wiig, two graduate students of CU-Boulder, reported the CRRL website, lidar simulation tools, and lidar DAQ and control suite being developed at CTC. Finally the workshop discussed a lidar school that CRRL is planning for summer 2009 and hoped to engage more students and researchers in the lidar activities.

</h4>
<p><b>0930-1130, pizza lunch, and 1300-1500 Wednesday 27 June Anasazi</b>
<br>
Keen interest in small satellites has been building in recent years based on their 
intrinsic capabilities to conduct science missions faster and cheaper than 
systems employing larger spacecraft. Whether individually or in constellations, 
small satellites represent a unique platform that provides significant scientific 
return while enabling users to test new technologies or to provide educational 
and training opportunities for students. This workshop is aimed at promoting 
the use of small satellites for remote or in-situ upper atmospheric sensing by 
providing a forum for members of the community to share their results, 
experiences, and recommendations.
<p>
In the morning session, invited talks will describe past and current missions as 
well as address systems engineering considerations and spacecraft operations, 
including launch systems and opportunities and funding resources.
<p>
Payload design, including novel sensor technologies, supporting CEDAR science 
will be explored in a series of invited talks during the lunch break following 
Session I.  A pizza lunch will be provided in the Anasazi Ballroom for the 
audience.
<p>
In the afternoon session, the educational opportunities associated with small 
satellite design, construction, and launch will be described in a series of invited 
talks. A panel discussion will follow, in which audience members may participate 
by giving brief presentations (1-2 slides, 5-minute time limit). Those wishing to 
contribute material should contact Lara Waldrop before June 25 (Monday).

I-T Challenges Based on Continuous Observations Through the IPY (or PRIMO II)
with conveners Jan J. Sojka, Tony van Eyken, Craig Heinselman, and John Holt
</h4>
<p><b>0930-1130 Wednesday 27 June Zia</b>
<br>
The International Polar Year (IPY) has begun.  On March 1, 2007 an extremely aggressive ISR observational campaign began.  The European EISCAT and NSF AMISR Incoherent Scatter teams are planning on running the EISCAT Svalbard and AMISR Poker Flat ISR on a low duty cycle continuously for the IPY.  The NSF's other ISR facilities will complement this unique data base with, where possible, twice per month 32 hour runs.  As these observational data streams grow and scientific analysis proceeds, the stage is set for a particularly exciting community wide, observation-model-theory challenge.
<p>
The IPY occurs during a period of extremely weak geomagnetic activity; hence, the conditions are ideal to investigate how coupling from the lower atmospheric regions affects the ionosphere and thermosphere (I-T).  This is an invitation for all I-T modelers to get involved in modeling the IPY, forecasting the remaining IPY period, and comparing their results with others, both models and observations.
<p>
This workshop will promote a "PRIMO" format in that all modelers and observers including, but not limited to, the above mentioned ISRs are relevant participants.  At this kick-off workshop the observing community will provide an overview of the first 3 months of IPY including an expos? of the unexpected.  The modelers will be given the opportunity to identify themselves as well as present their first predictions for the IPY year long observations.  The open workshop format is then to take input and debate from those present.  It is hoped that this is the first of several such workshops over the IPY period.  Although focused on the unique high latitude IPY aspect, the relevance to eGY and IHY is appreciated and not excluded.  To get involved,
contact Jan Sojka at:  sojka@cc.usu.edu, or one of the other organizers.  (If you are too young to know about PRIMO, definitely attend.)

A. van Eyken</a>, EISCAT Svalbard Radar during the International Polar Year
</ul>
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
This was the kick-off meeting for an international campaign that will leverage in a unique way incoherent scatter radar's (ISR) ability to make continuous long term observations of the ionosphere for studies of the ionosphere in which weather effects can be separated from climatology.  Furthermore, during the International Polar Year (IPY), solar minimum period, address the degree to which the lower atmosphere controls the ionospheric variability.  
<p>
Thirty-two workshop participants heard first from the ISR teams concerning the observations already made.  IPY began March 1, 2007 and by CEDAR over three months of observations had been collected by European Svalbard Radar (ESR) and Poker Flat ISR (PFISR).  These observations were presented by Tony van Eyken and Craig Heinselman respectively.  In addition to these two radars the ISR at Sondrestrom and Millstone Hill are running  on a regular schedule of about 32 hours each month and presentation of these observations were made by Craig Heinselman and John Holt respectively.  John Holt also provided information that the Irkutsk ISR will be running long duration runs repeatedly during the IPY period.  A series of 9 modelers then presented information about their interest and modeling capability for this IPY I-T challenge:  M. Codrescu (CTIPe); L. Scherliess (USU-GAIM); L. Goncherenko (Millstone Hill modeling collaborations); D. Pawlowski (Univ. of Michigan); D. Siskind (NOGAPS-ALPHA); P. Richards (FLIP); V. Eccles (IFM); J. Sojka (TDIM); and C. Fesen (TIEGCM).  
<p>
The workshop focused on how the large quantities of observations would be made easily accessible, i.e., through Madrigal but in higher level formats, for instance ISR level 4 reduced format.  Another aspect was how the models should run to best simulate the IPY conditions.  A number of resolutions were put forward:
<ol type=i>
<li>A kp of 2+, F10.7 of 70, and F10.7 average of 70 should be used for climatology year long model forecasts;
<li>Model runs should be made for each of the 5 ISR locations;
<li>Where possible the NRLMSIS should be used;
<li>SuperDARN convection patterns should be made available for all modelers to use as the high latitude magnetospheric electric field driver for the IPY period.
</ol>
<p>
On top of the success and enthusiasm for this IPY International Campaign Tony van Eyken also gave us the good news that his proposal to have an International Space Science Institute (ISSI) set of workshops on this topic has been approved.  Hence, the participants will have multi-day dedicated workshop opportunities in Switzerland over the next few year to address the IPY I-T challenges.

Radar chain, satellite observations and modelling of Nov 2004 storm                       
with convener Mike Kelley
</h4>
<p><b>0930-1130 and 1600-1800 Wednesday 27 June Sunset</b>
<br>
A number of superstorms have been studied in the last five years including the Bastille Day and Halloween events. The November 2004 event is unique in that World Day operations occurred in the last half of the storm.  Strong evidence exists for periods of over and under-shielding as well as a disturbance dynamo (DD) at the Jicamarca location. A number of effects on generation of equatorial spread F can be related to these electric field variations which included record upward drifs (<120 m/s). Satellite data indicate very low equatorial densities and molecular ions at high altitudes.  These and other factors will be compared to models such as the TIMEGCM and the AFRL spread F predictions.  Researchers familiar with other storms are very welcome to participate.

Optical Calibration Techniques and Issues
with conveners Susan Nossal, Jeff Baumgardner, and Mike Taylor
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Zia and 1600-1800 Anasazi North Wednesday 27 June</b>
<br>
Accurate calibration is important for comparing observations taken by 
different instruments, for model-data comparisons, and for acquiring 
long-term data records. This workshop will address techniques and 
issues associated with calibration of optical instruments and data.  We 
welcome contributions on a broad range of topics including absolute and 
relative intensity calibration, line center calibration, 
inter-calibration of instruments, and approaches and tools for 
accounting for the influence of factors such as tropospheric scattering 
  and viewing geometry.  One of the topics for this year's workshop will 
be a discussion of the NSF optical aeronomy calibration facility being 
developed at Boston University.  We have extended the workshop to four 
hours to enable more time for open discussion regarding the development 
of community strategies for coordinated calibration.  Please contact 
Jeff Baumgardner (jeffreyb@bu.edu; 617-353-5639) or Susan Nossal 
(nossal@physics.wisc.edu; 608-262-9107) if you would like to contribute 
a short presentation.
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
The CEDAR Optical Calibration Techniques and Issues workshop is becoming an annual opportunity for discussion of methods and strategies for calibration of passive optical instruments.  Accurate calibration is important for facilitating inter-comparison between data sets, data-model comparisons, and the interpretation of long-term data sets.  Careful calibration and accounting for correction factors can be challenging and time consuming but important for acquiring accurate data.
<p>
Josh Semeter began this year's workshop with a presentation of the use of an EMCCD (electron multiplier charge coupled device) camera for observations to detect fine scale structure in the aurora.  In principle such detectors have no read noise, however the detector must be kept very cold to reduce dark noise.  The EMCCD has high time resolution.  There is a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution.  Semeter's EMCCD-based instrument is being used to observe the aurora in conjunction with the AMISR campaign.
<p>
One of the most exciting advances for the community is the development of a NSF aeronomy optical calibration facility at Boston University by Jeff Baumgardner who led a presentation about the facility at the workshop. The first phase is to provide a calibration facility where filters can be measured and characterized.  Filters can degrade in sensitivity and the band pass can shift with time.  The calibration facility uses a McPherson Spectrometer to characterize filters at different positions and tilt angles.   Researchers are invited to send their filters to Boston University for characterization. Carl Schmidt, who is working with Baumgardner, presented a poster giving a progress report on the Boston University Calibration Facility for Optical Aeronomy. This poster is included on the wiki site for the optical calibration workshop.
<p>
The next phase planned for the calibration facility is to develop a portable "standard" spectrophotometer for brightness calibration.  The importance of a portable, NIST traceable, spectrophotometer or alternatively a standard lamp was emphasized in a presentation made by Don Hampton of the University of Alaska.  The planned Boston University portable spectrophotometer would have a spectral range of 3800-8400 Angstroms and a resolution of 9 Angstroms, suitable for the calibration of imagers and photometers, but not for high-resolution interferometry.  Two sources will be built, one of which will be kept at Boston University for cross-calibration purposes, and the other shipped to the instrument to be calibrated.
<p>
Baumgardner also discussed a new background subtraction method for subtracting stars and the Milky Way from All-Sky Images.  Traditional filtering methods do not work well for subtracting large saturated areas such as the Milky Way.  The new method uses a Mercator projection of an all-sky image.  A background image is constructed by remapping off-band images to the desired time before subtraction from the on-band image of the observation.
<p>
Steve Smith discussed the calibration of the Boston University Imaging Meridional Spectrograph.  This instrument is used to investigate the OH layer and temperature at about 87 km.  After dark subtraction and flat-field corrections have been applied, the dispersion relationship is determined using known spectral line positions and the absolute brightness is calibrated using a Tungsten reference lamp.  Mesospheric temperatures are then calculated using intensity ratios of OH band lines.  Smith showed comparisons between mesospheric temperatures obtained from the SABER instrument on TIMED and the Imaging Meridional Spectrograph that showed strong agreement between the two data sets.
<p>
Susan Nossal discussed the use of nebular calibration sources for calibrating observations of geocoronal hydrogen emissions over a time period spanning three solar minima.  Nebular sources offer advantages of long-term stability, being line emission sources, and minimizing atmospheric corrections as both the calibration and observational sources are outside of the Earth's atmosphere.  Observations of nebular sources at different zenith angles can be used to infer atmospheric transmission properties to correct observations for atmospheric extinction. Challenges to using nebular calibration include the requirements for identifying and calibrating a source with the spectral line of interest, accurate pointing and tracking capabilities, viewing of a wide spectral range, and that the nebular sources are not always visible.  Nossal also discussed other data quality and correction factors important for multi-year comparisons, including the accounting for hydrogen emissions from the Galaxy that is one of the most important analysis considerations for obtaining accurate geocoronal hydrogen data.
<p>
One of the challenges for passive optics calibration is to accurately document methods to facilitate comparison between data sets and to pass on techniques to other researchers.  Accurate documentation facilitates the ability of future scientists to compare their observations with present day observations.  Pam Loughmiller has made important contributions toward addressing these challenges.  She gave an overview of a comprehensive and rigorous document that she is writing to describe processing, calibrations and corrections applied to imaging data.  Included in this document are procedures for filter characterization, radiometric calibrations to obtain absolute brightness measurements and spatial calibration of imaging data.
<p>
Following the presentations and associated discussions was a period of more informal dialogue, including small group discussions.  One suggestion was to use the CEDAR wiki as a vehicle for continuing to share information about airglow calibration techniques and issues.
<p>
Also included on the CEDAR wiki are resources contributed by John French of the Australian Antarctic Division describing calibration of the OH spectrometer used to acquire a 12-year climatology of mesospheric OH temperatures from Davis, Antarctica.  French, who was not able to attend the meeting, also includes a document detailing his calibration of a low brightness calibration source at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Impact of electric fields during ionospheric storms
with conveners Chaosong Huang and Tim Fuller-Rowell
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Wednesday 27 June Sunset</b>
<br>
Magnetic storms can cause very large disturbances in the global 
ionosphere. The IMF is strongly southward during the main phase of 
intense storms, and the interplanetary electric field can penetrate to 
the low-latitude ionosphere. In the equatorial ionosphere, enhanced 
electric fields move the F-region plasma upward, creating extremely deep 
depletions of the plasma density over the a large latitudinal range. The 
ionospheric plasma density is significantly increased at lower 
midlatitudes on the dayside and near dusk, producing the positive storm 
phase. Large density enhancements occur in the dusk sector, and an 
enhanced TEC band extends from the low latitudes to polar cap. Although 
significant progress has been achieved in these areas, a number of 
outstanding problems have not been fully understood.
<p>
In this workshop, we will discuss the following problems. What are the 
lifetimes of penetration and dynamo electric fields during the different 
phases of a storm on the day and nightside? What is the relative 
importance of penetration electric fields and disturbance dynamo effects 
in the generation of global ionospheric plasma density disturbances? How 
can the relative contributions from electric fields and neutral 
disturbances to ionospheric storms be separated?

<br>
Users and friends of the Jicamarca Radio Observatory will be holding a
workshop to review activities from the past year and to prepare for
the upcoming one. Both long-duration and rapid response runs are
increasingly being requested, and Jicamarca's response to these and
other important programs, especially COSMIC and LISN, need to be
discussed and planned. A number of new experimental modes are coming
online at Jicamarca which need to be coordinated to optimize observing
time. New hardware including more digital receivers, an absolute
calibration system, SOUSY, the AMISR-7, and a long-baseline
interferometer have appeared. The bistatic Jicamarca-Paracas link
continues to run, and its exploitation also needs coordination. New
optical apparatus may be coming to Jicamarca, and plans for an HF
modification facility are taking shape.  The status of educational
activities like the visiting scientist program, the intern program,
and the upcoming LISN school will be reviewed. Finally, science
highlights from the past year will be presented.

Optical and Radar Observations of Spread-F</a> by Jonathan Makela
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
Users and friends of the Jicamarca Radio Observatory held a workshop
to review activities from the past year and to prepare for the
upcoming one. The discussions divided into three categories of
research: equatorial optical aeronomy, plasma instability theory, and
the theory of incoherent scatter at small aspect angles. The session
also included reviews of new educational and user support programs and
hardware upgrades. 
<p>
The director of the observatory, Jorge Chau, presented research
highlights from the past year including:
<ol>
<li>New mesospheric wind capabilities using a specular meteor radar
(JASMET). This meteor system complements the mesospheric winds
obtained with the classical MST mode by allowing nighttime
measurements and higher altitudinal coverage (80-100 km, instead of
65-85 km). (See Figure 1.)

<li>Multi-frequency observations of spread F and meteor echoes using
the main Jicamarca VHF system and the 7-panel AMISR prototype. The
preliminary results indicate that echoes from topside plumes appear to
be weaker than expected at UHF. (See Figures 2 and 3.)

<li>First clear observations of cats-eye and fossil turbulence
structures using the high resolution capabilities of the SOUSY system
at Jicamarca. These results are in excellent agreement with recent
results from numerical simulations. (See figures 4 and 5.)

<li>New hardware developments. New antennas have been and are being set
up for improved north-south interferometric measurements of
ionospheric irregularities. Using off-the-shelf digital receiver
cards, JRO can now utilize up to 12 digital receiver channels
simultaneously, allowing, for example, three dimensional imaging of
ionospheric structures with very high angular resolution.
</ol><p>
A new generation of optical instrumentation is emerging in Latin
America, and this is contributing to research in both background and
irregularity physics. John Meriwether reviewed findings from Arequipa
and elsewhere concerning the midnight temperature maximum and proposed
a model involving convergent thermospheric winds and subsidence. Andy
Gerrard presented an update on the SOFDI FPI project, showing
promising results from tests conducted in New York. SOFDI will be
critical for providing thermospheric wind and temperature information
needed to complete our understanding of ionospheric dynamics, current
circulation, and stability. Jonathan Makela compared optical imagery
of spread F depletions with radar observations and showed how common
features could be collocated and tracked.
<p>
Next, Joe Huba showed simulations of equatorial spread F made with a
new model that incorporates much less numerical dissipation than has
been necessary in the past. The morphology of the depletions that
emerged in simulation was remarkably similar to what is seen in
optical imagery. Meers Oppenheim then showed finely detailed
particle-in-cell simulations of Farley Buneman waves. The simulations
incorporated new particle heating diagnostics that made it possible to
compare the phase speed of the primary waves with the theoretical ion
acoustic speed. Three-dimensional simulations that could further close
the gap between the two figures are planned. 
<p>
Jicamarca is unique among the upper atmospheric facilities in its
ability to measure incoherent scatter at very small aspect
angles. This complicates the theory enormously but also permits
certain unique measurements to be made. Marco Milla reviewed the theory
and discussed the simultaneous measurement of power, electron and ion
temperature, and drifts at small aspect angles. Fabiano Rodrigues
compared electron density profiles measured at small aspect angles
with Faraday rotation measurements and also reviewed recent hydrogen
gyroresonance measurements. Finally, Pablo Reyes showed how to measure
the absolute scattering cross section of mesospheric irregularities by
incorporating simultaneous incoherent scatter measurements.
<p>
A new summer student program has been instituted at Jicamarca, and its
first graduate, Akshay Malhorta, shared his experiences. Akshay has
been working with range-spread meteor echoes and has shown how the
echoes arrive from the locus of perpendicularity. A remote reserving
site has been constructed near the main observatory to assess how the
range-spread echoes appear given different scattering geometries.
Akshay has returned to Jicamarca several times, and the student
program appears to be an effective means of enlarging the Jicamarca
user community.

satellite measurements and recommends the vigorous pursuit of 
opportunities for collaboration with satellite programs. Recent 
developments at NASA suggest that satellite missions are becoming 
less frequent and there is a significant possibility that recently 
planned ionosphere/thermosphere missions will be delayed 
indefinitely. This workshop is to elicit discussion and develop a 
concrete plan to address CEDAR science by coordinating measurements 
from the ground and space, in light of these new developments. 
Several other recent developments are: the NSF Small Satellite 
Conference, reports from the Distributed Array of Small Instruments, 
opportunities to collaborate on international missions and 
announcements of opportunity from NASA planned for 2008. Fundamental 
unanswered questions in I/T science will be highlighted. How will we 
address these? What are the science questions that are best served by 
coordinating ground and satellite observations? In what ways do 
space-based measurements complement ground-based results? Justifying 
satellite missions that benefit the ionosphere-thermosphere community 
requires a cohesive and well-articulated community approach. A 
dedicated meeting is planned for this fall devoted to 
ionosphere/thermosphere measurements from space. This CEDAR workshop 
will begin with 2-3 brief presentations and will continue with a 
panel discussion. We look forward to input by community members, 
leading to a set of priorities and action items.

<h4>Meeting Minutes:</h4>

Clemmons: We need a unity approach. 
<br>Pfaff: Lower ionosphere sampled poorly.
DE-2 had a full complement of I-T instruments. 

<br>Forbes:
We are promoting methodologies. We need to promote science first. Let's produce a document containing what are the outstanding science questions. Use it to promote CEDAR science at NASA. 

<br>Moderator: Should the document contain prioritized science objectives?
Comment: the missions end up prioritizing the science. 
[This implies a prioritized list of missions accomplishes both objectives.]

<br>Thayer: Developing science themes. Fluxes are the key thing that drives the I-T system to change. Response of I-T is very different on different time scales. The neutral gas "integrates" in time. Past history is critical.

<br>Earle: We need to stop being scientists for while. We are lousy salesmen. We need to act more like ad men. New mental images. Take on the challenge as sellers.

<br>Thayer: We need to look at our science problems.

<br>Paxton: Coordinate observational and theoretical studies to challenge what we think we know. Arguing is good.

<br>REMARK: Let's "universalize" our science themes and point out how other systems have similar features and questions. Learning about I-T helps us learn about other multi-scale/multi-temporal systems, and about magnetic reconnection, which is about the transition from frozen flow to diffusion across field lines. By studying I-T, we can learn about this process and therefore gain insight into universal processes.
<p>
<ul>Audience Participation:</ul>

<br>Why did ISTP get bumped?

<br>Past roadmapping efforts were limited. The people were limited and the process was not ideal.

<br>McCoy: We've been unsuccessful marketing to NASA but not to other sponsors. Others are convinced. Is there competition from planetary?

<br>Roger Smith: We've been thinking in too compartmentalized a fashion. It's a marketing issue. Car analogy: we are experts on the "engine" part or the tires part. Need to take a different perspective.
[Perhaps as the region where the energy deposited. We've been studying how the energy gets here, but we don't know what happens to it when it gets here. We don't know how it divided among the different part of the atmosphere.]

<br>John Foster: Lately NASA is not grass roots. Top down. Know who we are selling to. We need to be relevant to the current administrative and political climate. We might need to transform our identity. What are the political directives?

<br>LWS used to highly relevant and was well justified as a program (with ITSP part of that).

<br>Pfaff: we've been criticized that we only look at wiggles. Things have changed on us since we were central.

<br>Earle: I'm not an insider. We need to play on their ball field. Someone needs to suggest our direction.

<br>Should we bother trying to be relevant to the exploration initiative?

<br>Pfaff: I-T is a unique medium: ions + neutrals.

<br>Earle: we need to come up with themes that resonate. Sell using analogies. "Oceans" the Earth is embedded in. Depth, power, tides, waves, etc.

<br>Cahoy: like oceans analogy. Think of exploration systems, S/C at different vantage points.

<br>Controversy: good or bad? There is yelling in the magnetospheric area. Warring groups of modelers. Two distinct theoretical approaches.
We need to identify the controversies. Start challenging each other. 
How does the Sun and reconnection affect our area? 
CCMC would like to help. 

<br>Forbes: Great solar-terrestrial observatory theme. This helped TIMED in the Senior Review. TIMED justified that way.
ITM mission looks good: need to know where the energy is going. 

<br>In the current climate at NASA, no progress is possible. Let's lay the ground work for the future.

<br>R. Link: Alan Stern and New Horizons: persistence. Pursue NASA singlehandedly.

<br>Both approaches (single person and community) need to be pursued in parallel.

<br>McCoy: pessimistic about NASA.
"This is our time" when major advances can be made. We can see patterns using GPS that we could not see before. Analogy when meteorologists were able to make major advances by analyzing measurements over large scales. 

<br>Perception: we are not dealing with fundamental physics. We need to bring this back into the marketing. Ocean analogy might help.

<br>In the "holistic" analogy, the system that Fisher is trying to understand has no "engine".

<br>Swenson: Waves was a strategic NASA mission. It was roadmapped. Small satellites can help to take some steps. First assessments can be made.

<br>[NOTE: the value of the larger strategic missions is it gives the students learning about small satellites a career path.]

<br>Foster: we've had "space weather" as a fundamental issue. How fundamental is I-T science? Space weather is OK or good for our packaging efforts.
But, let's not be confined by it. 

<br>What is the outside forcing upon us? We need to broaden who we are. We should not fear applications, or DoD's application interest.

<br>Paxton: analogy with weather: to predict, we need to know.

<br>Should we consider comparative atmospheres? Are we being too myopic?

<br>Forbes: planetary atmospheres folks like terrestrial folks. Build bridges.

<br>Clemmons: NASA abdicating I-T is a big deal and a big national problem.

<br>Are we a powerful community?

<br>Earle: it's a slippery slope. We can't count on national needs.

<br>McCoy: weather analogy: NASA develops weather sensors for NOAA. Code S "does not get it" in the same way.
<p>
<ul>Post-Meeting Comments:</ul>
<p>
Outstanding question: why hasn't more progress been made since CEDAR Phase III document on our science questions? 
<p>
Why participate in future roadmapping efforts until we are given an explanation as to why past roadmapping efforts were ignored.

Opportunities for collaborative aeronomical research at Millstone Hill
with conveners Steve Smith and Qian Wu
</h4>
<p><b>1930-2130 Wednesday 27 June Zia</b>
<br>
A consortium of institutions - Boston University, Scientific Solutions 
Inc., HAO NCAR, and MIT Haystack Observatory - are planning to 
re-establish the optical aeronomical research effort at Millstone Hill. 
A high-resolution daytime echelle spectrograph and two new Fabry-Perot 
interferometers will be installed at the facility within the next 24 
months, supplementing the Boston University all-sky imager and imaging 
spectrograph operating currently. In collaboration with the Millstone 
Hill ISR, the new instrument cluster will yield multi-diagnostic 
measurements of the mesosphere and thermosphere. Several initial 
investigations are planned. We are keen to hear from interested imembers 
of the aeronomy community about being involved in these and any other 
new collaborative projects at Millstone Hill. To begin with, a series of 
short (5-10 minutes) talks are planned to introduce the new planned 
facility and instruments. The second half of the workshop will be a 
discussion on the planned activities and any new ones offered up.

Ionospheric studies using radio occultation electron density profiles
with conveners Kerri Cahoy, Stig Syndergaard, Theodore Beach and Ethan Miller
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Thursday 28 June Anasazi North</b>
<br>
The radio occultation method retrieves profiles of electron density from 200-400 km altitude (F-region) with high vertical resolution and global sampling. Electron density profiles can be used to study ionospheric phenomena over daily or seasonal time scales that are geographically localized or global-scale.
<p>
This tutorial-format workshop covers the fundamentals of how the radio occultation method remotely senses Earth's atmosphere using low-earth orbiting constellations such as COSMIC / FORMOSAT-3 to receive GPS signals. We present specifics of how the UCAR Cosmic Data Analysis Archive Center (CDAAC) retrieves electron density profiles from the radio occultation measurements, followed by a tutorial on how to set up a system to download, read, and analyze data from CDAAC with netcdf and MATLAB. Three exciting examples using electron density follow: (1) assimilating electron density profiles into the GAIM ionospheric model, (2) setting up a system for long-term statistical studies of scintillation using CDAAC data that corresponds to ground site data, (3) fusing radio occultation data with ground-based airglow imagery using Google Earth for visualization of scintillation-causing irregularities in three dimensions.
<ul>
<li>13:00-13:15 - Exploring the solar system with radio occultation (K. Cahoy, Stanford). The planetary heritage, math, and physics behind the radio occultation method, and how it has been applied on earth using GPS and low-earth orbiting satellites.

<li>13:15-13:45 - Retrieval of electron density profiles (S. Syndergaard, UCAR). How radio occultation measurements are used to derive electron density profiles at CDAAC.

<li>13:45-14:00 - Download and analyze electron density profiles (K. Cahoy, Stanford). Introducing the CDAAC data tool and how to download and analyze electron density profiles using netcdf and MATLAB.

<li>14:00-14:20 - Assimilating COSMIC occultation data into a global ionosphere model
(JPL/USC GAIM) (B. Wilson, JPL). How the high vertical resolution and global coverage of COSMIC radio occultation measurements will enable ionospheric data assimilation models to specify the 3D ionosphere (electron density altitude profiles) much more accurately.

<li>14:20-14:40 - Ionospheric scintillation applications to complement GPS ground site data (T. Beach, AFRL). This application takes into consideration the geometry of selecting useful occultation lines of sight near ground sites, and how you would automate data retrieval from CDAAC for long-term statistical studies.

<li>14:40-15:00 - Visualization of ionospheric scintillation (E. Miller, UIUC). Fusing ground-based airglow imagery and estimated scintillation indices from radio occultation receivers to localize scintillation-causing irregularities in three dimensions, with special emphasis using MATLAB and Google Earth tools. Data from the COSMIC / FORMOSAT-3 mission and a field-aligned airglow imager at Cerro Tololo, Chile.
</ul>
<p>
We welcome our colleagues to bring their own applications and topics for group discussion.
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
The successful launch and operation of the GPS radio occultation receivers
on the COSMIC/Formosat-3 constellation, in addition to the availability of
data from long-term precursor missions such as CHAMP, have substantially
augmented the number, geographic and temporal resolution of electron density
profiles available to the community. This workshop focused first on a
general introduction of the method and the profile retrieval, and followed
with examples of how these data compliment and support both modeling efforts
and analyses with other instruments, such as incoherent scatter radar and
airglow imagery.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/e/ef/2007-06-28-CEDAR-Cahoy.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
K. Cahoy</a> (Stanford) introduced the session and presented the planetary
exploration heritage of the radio occultation method, and how the "classic"
geometry used for capturing profiles of planetary atmospheres from an
orbiter or during a fly-by was updated for application to remote sensing of
our own Earth's atmosphere, using GPS signals.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/d/dc/Ionprf_cedar07.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
S. Syndergaard</a> (UCAR) followed up with a detailed discussion of how electron
density profiles are retrieved from the radio occultation observables,
starting from the Appleton-Hartree (Appleton-Lassen) equation and
progressing through how TEC can be calculated using the combination of L1
and L2 phase paths. Different boundary (auxiliary) conditions were discussed
for different experimental configurations (e.g. CHAMP versus
COSMIC/Formosat-3). A brief description of COSMIC/Formosat-3 and the Cosmic
Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) were also presented, as well as
previews of some seasonal studies being done using this data by postdoctoral
students at UCAR.
<p>
The workshop completed its general background and tutorial segment with an
introduction of the different centers that currently have publicly available
electron density profiles, such as CDAAC and the JPL Genesis system as well
as often the home institutions of the spacecraft mission. The NetCDF file
format was briefly discussed as well as simple ways that MATLAB and other
computational analysis software suites could be used to simply query the
data.
<p>
B. Wilson (JPL) discussed how to assimilate COSMIC occultation data into a
global ionosphere model (JPL/USC GAIM), and how the high vertical resolution
and global coverage of COSMIC radio occultation measurements will enable
ionospheric data assimilation models to specify the 3D ionosphere (electron
density altitude profiles) much more accurately.
<p>
T. Beach's (AFRL) presentation (via proxy, due to the Texas flooding at the
time) focused on how to determine which electron density profiles would be
most useful for comparative studies (with specific examples using incoherent
scatter radar). The geometry and the atmospheric volume sensed during each
radio occultation experiment were discussed, improving understanding of the
paths traveled by the signals from which the resulting electron density
profiles were retrieved.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/e/ed/CEDAR2007_occ_scints_final.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
E. Miller</a> (UIUC) closed the session with a particularly cool visualization
of ionospheric scintillation, fusing ground-based airglow imagery and
estimated scintillation indices from radio occultation receivers to localize
scintillation-causing irregularities in three dimensions, with special
emphasis using MATLAB and Google Earth tools. Data from the COSMIC /
FORMOSAT-3 mission and a field-aligned airglow imager at Cerro Tololo, Chile
were used.
<p>
The workshop brought together researchers from various communities
(simulation, optical measurements, radar measurements, and others). The
tutorial-style initial format successfully segued into more detailed
applications, allowing researchers unfamiliar with the data to not only get
a quick-look of how it was acquired and made available, but also how it
could be applied in comparative studies with other models, campaigns and
data archives. K. Cahoy would like to thank all presenters for their
expertise, enthusiasm, and much-appreciated contributions.

The Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) Mission
with convener Richard Eastes
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 Thursday 28 June Zia</b>
<br>
The Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission will provide the first large-scale observations of temperatures in the lower thermosphere, in addition to more familiar measurements such as auroral locations and energy inputs; peak electron densities in the nighttime ionosphere; and atomic oxygen to molecular nitrogen (O/N2) ratios. GOLD can provide nearly continuous real-time observations of one hemisphere. Combined with the current models of the ionosphere and thermosphere, measurements from GOLD will revolutionize our understanding of the global-scale response of the thermosphere and ionosphere to geomagnetic and solar forcing. The goal of the workshop is to 1) Describe the anticipated observations by the GOLD imager, which is being considered for flight by NASA as a Mission of Opportunity; 2) Examine potential for use of GOLD observations by the CEDAR community; and 3) Examine possibilities for use of ground based observations for validation of GOLD observations. Data and capabilities from the CEDAR community will play a critical role in enabling measurements from GOLD to enhance space weather specification and forecasting capabilities.

Application of SuperDARN radar observations to CEDAR research
with conveners Bill Bristow (UAF), Mike Ruohoniemi (JHU/APL), and Simon Shepherd
(Dartmouth College)
</h4>
<p><b>1300-1500 and 1600-1800 Thursday 28 June Sunset</b>
<br>
Over the past two decades the international network of HF radars, that is
now known as SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network), has been making
measurements of ionospheric electric fields associated with plasma drifts
primarily in the polar F-region ionosphere. The current network of 20
radars (13 in the northern and 7 in the southern hemisphere) are capable
of making measurements on spatial scales ranging from less than 100 km to
near simultaneous coverage of the high-latitude, and at time scales as
low as several seconds. Over these years SuperDARN has contributed greatly
to CEDAR science in many ways by providing spatially distributed
measurements of electric fields during rocket campaigns, satellite
over-flights, and for space weather now-casting.
<p>
The network has recently experienced a wave of expansion with a radar pair
operated by the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon situated to look over
the northern magnetic pole and two new radars operated by JHU/APL and
Virginia Tech. in the mid-latitude region. As coverage by SuperDARN
continues to expand, the opportunities to learn more about the dynamic
ionospheric processes that can span these different regions (polar,
high-latitude, mid-latitude) increases with the combined use of
measurements from a variety of instruments, including SuperDARN.
<p>
This session is intended to illustrate the role SuperDARN can and has
played in CEDAR research. We are asking for participating from those in
the CEDAR community who have used SuperDARN over the years or who would
like to learn more about its capabilities.
<p>
Following an overview of the SuperDARN system and recent expansions, it
is anticipated that a series of brief presentations and discussion be
given by researchers using SuperDARN measurements in the areas of space
weather, meteor winds, modeling, planetary waves, plasma patches, gravity
waves, ionospheric currents, and other related CEDAR science.

Combining DMSP and SuperDARN observations of polar and midlatitude
ionospheric convection</a>
</ul>
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
This workshop presented an opportunity for CEDAR participants to become 
aware of the availability of data and derived products from the SuperDARN 
HF radars that can be applied to CEDAR science.  In addition to the 
well-known ionospheric convection products, these include space weather, 
meteor winds, atmospheric tides, gravity waves, plasma structuring and 
PMSEs.  The ongoing expansions of SuperDARN into the polar region and the 
mid-latitude zone made it timely to review for the benefit of oldtimers 
and students alike the range of ionospheric and atmospheric processes that 
are accessible to the radars.
<p>
The workshop kicked off with a comprehensive review of SuperDARN by
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/3/38/SuperDARNoverview-Bristow.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Bill Bristow</a> (UAF). He looked back over the history of the HF backscatter
technique and traced the evolution of the methods for mapping plasma 
convection in the high-latitude ionosphere.  He explained the 
multinational workings of the collaboration and described plans for 
continued expansion of the network.  He was followed by
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/1/1a/Expansion_-_SuperDARN-Ruohoniemi.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Mike Ruohoniemi</a>
(JHU/APL), who elaborated on the push into polar latitudes with the 
PolarDARN system of radars, which is a project directed by the University 
of Saskatchewan.  He showed results from the new Rankin Inlet radar that 
illustrated the richness of effects in plasma convection and plasma 
structuring in the polar cap. He also described results on mid-latitude 
effects such as SAPS seen with the new mid-latitude radar at Wallops 
Island and reported that the newest mid-latitude radar operated out of 
Hokkaido by StelLabs is producing exciting observations of convection and 
gravity waves.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/e/e3/IPY-SuperDARN.ppt" target="cedarweb_aux">
Jan Sojka</a> (USU) spoke to the modelers interest in acquiring extensive
convection electric field measurements as an essential input for modeling 
the ionosphere.  He emphasized the need for actual measurements as opposed 
to climatological model predictions to properly capture the full range of 
dynamic behavior.  He lead a brief discussion of the incorporation of 
SuperDARN velocity data into the modeling effort related to the IPY, which 
commenced on March 1 of this year.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/9/9a/Talaat_-_SuperDARN_winds.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Elsayed Talaat</a> (JHU/APL) shifted the discussion to the neutral atmosphere.
Specifically, he described analysis of meteor wind data from SuperDARN 
that showed dramatically the effect of atmospheric tides and planetary 
waves.  He showed that with the long time series available from some of 
the radars it is now possible to examine trends over a solar cycle.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/5/54/CEDAR_talk_THEMIS_sht.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
Stephen Mende</a> (SSL) described the NASA THEMIS mission, which is directed
towards solving the substorm timing problem by combining measurements from 
multi-satellite conjunctions in the magnetotail with extensive 
ground-based observations of substorm effects in the ionosphere over North 
America.  The prime period for substorm conjunctions will begin in 
February, 2008, however, the spacecraft are aloft and are collecting data. 
He showed an example of a substorm onset from this year (March 23) that 
was observed in Alaska while the satellites were conjugate to the Siberian 
ionosphere.  The timings of effects between the satellites were discussed 
and the simultaneous SuperDARN data were reviewed. The radar data showed 
very clearly the impact of the onset and the effect on convection in the 
southern hemisphere was particularly dramatic. There was also a discussion 
of THEMIS radar modes.
<p>
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/5/5d/SD_Wallops_CEDAR_Brief.ppt" target="cedarweb_aux">
Phil Erickson</a> (MIT Haystack) described a joint experiment between the
Millstone Hill radar and the Wallops SuperDARN radar. The combined 
measurements reveal that a category of low velocity subauroral HF 
backscatter is due to irregularities generated in the crossed temperature 
and density gradients of the mid-latitude trough that might serve as a 
marker of the plasmapause.
<p>
After the break Mike Ruohoniemi (JHU/APL) spoke briefly on
<a href="http://cedar-l.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/images/0/0d/PMSE.pdf" target="cedarweb_aux">
observations of PMSEs</a>

of substorms in the THEMIS era and discussed how the integration of data 
from multiple sources that is realized in SuperDARN is a model for the 
newer systems.

ionospheric convection that raised questions about the intercalibration of 
data from disparate techniques.

Simon Shepherd</a>
(Dartmouth) illustrated the space weather monitoring
capabilities of the SuperDARN network by showing an example of the 
ionospheric response to the geomagnetic storm that occurred on April 6, 
2000. Global aspects of the disturbance included an increase in the polar 
cap potential, increased convection velocities, increased number of radar 
returns, and expansion of the convection region to lower latitudes. In 
addition, near simultaneous response was observed at all eight radars in 
the northern hemisphere and all five radars in the southern hemisphere; 
spanning over 15 hours of local time. The rapid expansion of the polar cap 
to lower latitudes demonstrated the need for expansion of radars to lower 
latitudes (StormDARN) to track the progression of ionospheric responses 
during geomagnetic storms.

Bill Bristow</a> (UAF) reviewed work on thermospheric gravity waves inferred
from SuperDARN observations of traveling ionospheric disturbances. He 
discussed the observations and how a gravity wave propagating in the 
neutral atmosphere produces a signature in radar observations. Much of the 
material presented was review of work from several years ago, however Bill 
showed some new results from Keisuke Hosokawa (DICE/UCE) using the new 
Hokkaido radar in conjunction with the Japanese GPS network observations 
of TEC. These new observations showed waves propagating all the way from 
Alaska to the southern end of Japan.
<p>
Most presentations were followed by a series of lively questions, mainly 
pertaining to the extension of SuperDARN capabilities to polar and 
mid-latitudes and to the exploitation of SuperDARN measurements of 
interest to aeronomy and atmospheric dynamics.

Characteristics and causes of MLT spatial and temporal variabilities
with conveners Jeng-Hwa Yee and Elsayed Talaat
</h4>
<p><b>1600-1800 Thursday 28 June Anasazi South</b>
(with Tue Yee Posters: MLT Climatology)
<br>
The combination of ground-based and satellite observations under the
TIMED/CEDAR program is providing unprecedented spatial and temporal
coverage of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region. The
ground-based instruments provide measurements of MLT winds and
temperatures at specific geographic locations over many local times and
complement the TIMED instruments, which provide similar measurements
globally at one or two local times on any given day. TIMED observations
also provide pressure, density, and other geophysical parameters
critical to understanding MLT energetics. When combined, these two data
sets can provide true mean fields and a higher-time-resolution 3-D
picture of atmospheric waves, especially tides, in order to understand
the processes that govern MLT coupling to the lower and upper atmosphere
and ionosphere. In addition, CEDAR investigators have collected MLT data
over almost two solar cycles with >5 years of coincident, continuous
TIMED observational data. The focus of this workshop is to foster
collaboration between satellite, ground-based, and modeling teams to
study the MLT energetics and basic structure, including zonal mean,
tides, and planetary waves and the causes of their temporal
variabilities (on daily, seasonal, QBO, and solar cycle time scales). We
encourage people to present recent observations and research findings
that can lead to fruitful collaborations.

Global Observations of the Upper Atmosphere and Ionosphere Using Coordinated World Days
with convener Wes Swartz
</h4>
<p><b>1600-1800 Thursday 28 June Anasazi North</b>
<br>
The URSI Incoherent Scatter Working Group (ISWG) will have its usual planning meeting at CEDAR to coordinate the World Day experiments involving the world's upper atmospheric observatories.  The procedures for scheduling World Day observations are described at
<a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/wes/URSI_ISWG/RequestingWD.htm" target="cedarweb_aux">
http://people.ece.cornell.edu/wes/URSI_ISWG/RequestingWD.htm</a>
and the other links referenced therein which include a sample proposal.  Written proposals are requested for meeting specific research needs using the World Day observations.  These proposals should be submitted by June 12 (an extended date).  The planning meeting is for the ISWG and UAF staffs to review all the proposals submitted and determine how the global network of ISRs can best satisfy the approved observational requests. The proposer's presence during this discussion is not required, but all are welcome, especially students.
<p>
The global network of incoherent scatter radars (ISR) provides observations of fundamental properties of the atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere.  Use of  these radars is open to all qualified scientists, and the data are freely disseminated to a broad community of users for research and in the development and validation of models and instrumentation. 
<p>
Radar observing time is allocated (1) to individuals or groups through either formal or informal requests to the institutions responsible for operating the facilities, and (2) for World Day observations coordinated through a plan developed annually by the URSI Incoherent Scatter Working Group (ISWG).
<p>
The high demand for ISR observations, in particular for extended multi-day and multi-radar operations, requires certain procedures to help ensure that the highest priority scientific research is addressed by the coordinated World Day schedule within the limits imposed by the cost and technical restrictions of ISR operations.
<p>
The process begins with the development of a baseline schedule of general-purpose experiments that fall within the operating constraints of the radars.  The baseline World Day schedule for 2008 and its updates will be available at
<a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/wes/URSI_ISWG/2008WDschedule.htm" target="cedarweb_aux">
	http://people.ece.cornell.edu/wes/URSI_ISWG/2008WDschedule.htm</a>.
If you are planning extended duration and/or multiple facility ISR experiments in 2008, you should review this schedule carefully to determine whether your observational requirements can be met by the provisional baseline observations.  If not, and if your experiment cannot be easily accommodated through requests to individual radar facilities, you will need to submit a proposal for additional or modified operations to the Chair of the ISWG (see below).  The deadline for the receipt of such proposals has been extended to June 12, but the sooner they are received the better. Instructions for preparing your request and a sample proposal are available at:
<a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/wes/URSI_ISWG/SampleWDproposal.doc" target="cedarweb_aux">
	http://people.ece.cornell.edu/wes/URSI_ISWG/SampleWDproposal.doc</a>.
If you are unsure whether or not your experiment requires the submission of a proposal, please contact the ISWG Chair or any staff member of an ISR facility.  The ISWG
will review these proposals along with any external reviews at its usual planning meeting at CEDAR to schedule the World Day experiments for calendar year 2008.  The ISWG group will determine how the global network of ISRs can best satisfy the approved observational requests and will ensure that the experimental configurations, numbers of radars involved, time distribution and total time allocated are appropriate for the specified science goals.  Although the proposer's presence during this discussion is not required, it is often useful for quick answers to additional answers that arise.  Students are also welcomed.
<p>
Please feel free to consult with any facility staff member for clarification on this new process for requesting ISR observing time within the World Day program.

<p><b>
Summary of Attendee Comments</b><p>
The International Polar Year (IPY) is continuing until at least March 1, 2008.  The EISCAT Svalbard radar has been running 24/7 for the full year, with Millstone Hill and Sondre Stromfjord running a day every two weeks.   Hence it was suggested that the World Days for January and February should coincide with the cadence established during 2007.  Also it was suggested that the 10-day run to study stratospheric warming should take advantage of the days allocated for the bi-weekly IPY runs.  All agreed that the enormous data set being produced during the IPY will be invaluable.  The attendees' thanks went to Tony van Eykin for his role in initiating this series of experiment.
<p><b>
Summary of the proposed 2008 World Days</b><p>
The objectives major World Day periods are summarized here.
<ol type=I>
<li>International Polar Year: Continuation of year long observations with the EISCAT Svalbard ISR (ESR)
<br>Key Objectives:
<ul>
<li>To provide an unprecedented data set with multiple applications.
<li>To provide correlative data for other instrumentation and models committed to the IPY.
<li>Background Conditions: Anything that comes along.
<li>ISRs Needed: ESR, and others as resources permit.
<li>Parameters to Measure: Standard.
<li>Contact: Tony van Eyken.
</ul>
<li>TEC Mapping: ISR/GPS Coordinated Observations of Electron Density Variations
<br>Key Objectives:
<ul>
<li>  To study latitudinal variations of the ionosphere in the American longitude sector.
<li>  To examine time and latitudinal variations of electron content in the plasmasphere.
<li>  To test the GPS TEC mapping function.
<li>  Background Conditions: A range of magnetic activity is preferred but not required. A summer week (5 days) with some magnetic activity would be good to complement the measurements of 2007 March 1-5 (which was magnetically quiet). We plan similar experiments for years ahead so that we can pick up different months for different years.
<li>  ISRs Needed: All.
<li>  Parameters to Measure: Standard ISR basic parameters, e.g., Ne, Ti, Te and line-of-sight ion velocity Vo.
<li>  Inferred parameters, such as meridional thermospheric winds and local electric fields, are desirable at least for Millstone Hill.
<li>  For our analysis, we need good height coverage and height/range resolution. The idea is to have a good ISR profile for both the bottomside and topside. Our intent is to determine the plasmaspheric content from the difference between the GPS TEC and the integrated ISR electron content. Because of this, the value of the F2 peak, and of the electron density above and below it, are very important for our analysis. Using a single very long pulse to make ISR measurements may result in significant smearing effects and would cause measurements below 200 km unusable for our study. We suggest either a short pulse with a long dwell (integration) time or a long pulse with interleaved Alternating Code. A time resolution of up to 30 min is acceptable.
<br>
We will use Millstone Hill's zenith and MISA data, taken almost simultaneously, to test how the slant TEC is mapped to the vertical TEC. So both local measurements and wide coverage are requested. The elevation scan is preferred.
<li>  For high latitude sites, we prefer elevation scans towards the South. First, that would generate line-of-sight TEC that can be compared with GPS TEC (few GPS satellites are overhead or in the north at high latitudes). Second, in the American Sector, combined Millstone and Sondrestrom data could provide good latitudinal coverage over subauroral and auroral areas.
<li>  For other sites, vertical observations would be fine. We ask for high altitude measurements from Arecibo.
<li>  Contacts: Shun-Rong Zhang, Anthea Coster.
</ul>
<li>C/NOFS: Communications / Navigation Outage Forecasting System
<br>The primary purpose of C/NOFS is to forecast the presence of ionospheric irregularities that adversely impact communication and navigation systems through
<ul>
<li> improved understanding of the physical processes active in the background ionosphere and thermosphere in which plasma instabilities grow;
<li> the identification of those mechanisms that trigger or quench the plasma irregularities responsible for signal degradation; and
<li> determining how the plasma irregularities affect the propagation of electro-magnetic waves.
<li>A satellite, now scheduled for launch in June of 2008 into a low inclination (130), elliptical (~ 400 x 700 km) orbit will be solely dedicated to the C/NOFS objectives. It will be equipped with sensors that measure ambient and fluctuating electron densities, ion and electron temperatures, AC and DC electric fields, magnetic fields, neutral winds, ionospheric scintillations, and electron content along the lines of sight between C/NOFS and the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation. The orbit will have a 45-day repeating precession. Complementary ground-based measurements including the Jicamarca and Altair radars are also critical to the success of the mission. Coordination with the World Days periods starting in August 2008 will be expected. (Requests for additional UAF radar time beyond the currently scheduled World Days are to be made directly to the respective observatory staffs once orbital characteristics are known.)
<li> Contacts: Odile de La Bedaujardiere, David Hysell, Wes Swartz
</ul>
<li>QP TIDs: Coordinated Study of Quasi-Periodic Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances with Extended Latitude Coverage
<br>Key Objectives:
<ul>
<li>  To determine whether gravity-wave induced medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) consistently observed at high geomagnetic latitudes under quiet geomagnetic conditions are at all related to the continuum of quasi-periodic thermospheric waves observed at both Arecibo, Millstone, and perhaps AMISR Poker Flat.
<li>  To Firmly establish the geophysical parameter range over which these quasi-periodic MSTIDs-that currently appear to defy theoretical explanation-exist.
<li>  Background Conditions: Low to moderate geomagnetic activity, New Moon.
<li>  ISRs Needed: All except Jicamarca, for three 48-hour runs.
<li>  Parameters to Measure: Continuous or near-continuous vertical power profiles through the E/Fregions (100-800 km) with the best time resolution possible. We must have 5 minute or better time resolution power profiles in order to properly filter the data to separate small amplitude waves from the normal variations of the ionosphere.
<li>Secondary Parameters to Measure: Dual-beam ion velocities commensurate with the primary objective.
<li>Contact: J.D. Mathews, F.T. Djuth, D. Livneh, I. Seker, M.P. Sulzer, C.A. Tepley, S.M. Smith, W.A. Bristow, J.C. Foster, and M. Nicolls.
</ul>
<li>Strat-Warming: Dynamics and Temperature of the Lower Thermosphere During Sudden Stratospheric Warming
<br>Key Objectives:
<ul>
<li>  To measure neutral wind (zonal and meridional components) and electron and ion temperatures in the lower thermosphere before and during sudden stratospheric warming.
<li>  To compare variations in temperature and winds to average variations observed by ISRs during the winter.
<li>  To compare variations in temperatures and winds to mesospheric response as given by MF and meteor radars and lidars.
<li>  To extend studies of stratospheric warming effects to the lower thermosphere and investigate possible coupling with the ionosphere
<li>  To examine the mechanisms responsible for variations in lower thermospheric dynamics and temperatures and investigate to what degree they can be related to sudden stratospheric warming.
<li>  Background Conditions: The observations need to be made before and during the sudden stratospheric warming. A 10-day campaign is requested, based on an alert to be issued either in January or February.
<li>  ISRs Needed: All, although the response at Arecibo and Jicamarca may be weak.
<li>  Parameters to Measure: LTCS mode - electron and ion temperatures from lowest possible altitude throughout the F-region, zonal and meridional components of neutral wind in the lower thermosphere (95-140km), F-region meridional wind. Temporal resolution can be sacrificed and data integration period increased in order to obtain data at lower altitudes.
<li>  Contacts: Larisa P. Goncharenko, Irfan Azeem, William Wardr.
</ul>
<li>Synoptic:
<br>These synoptic experiments are intended to emphasize wide coverage of the F-region, with some augmented coverage of the topside or E-region to fill in areas of the data bases that have relatively little data.

Lightning effects on the upper atmosphere
with conveners Mark Stanley, Mike Taylor, and Ningyu Liu
</h4>
<p><b>1600-1800 Thursday 28 June Zia with internet</b>
<br>
This workshop will focus on the effects of lightning discharges on the mesospheric and lower ionospheric regions. Results from observational, theoretical and modeling studies regarding the energetic coupling of lightning with the upper atmosphere will be presented. Of particular interest are contributions on thermal, chemical and electrical effects of lightning on the upper atmosphere. Electromagnetic energy provided by lightning discharges in these regions is converted to other forms of energy though heating of ambient electrons. Excitation, dissociation and ionization of neutral molecules during this process modifies the atmospheric environment. Transient luminous events (TLEs-sprites, sprite halos, jets, elves) are a direct manifestation of this modification. New results from experimental and theoretical studies of these phenomena and their related effects will be discussed. New techniques and advances in remote sensing of the upper atmosphere with lightning will also be examined. The workshop will begin with an in depth introduction to the topic as well as presentations regarding the latest research on the modifications of the upper atmosphere due to lightning. This will be followed by a panel discussion on the interpretation of existing data and models. Audience participation in these discussions is strongly encouraged.
<h4><font color = red>Final Report</font></h4>
The Lightning Effects on the Upper Atmosphere workshop was held on Thursday, 28 June 2007 in the Zia room.  The workshop focused on the effects of lightning discharges on the mesospheric and lower ionospheric regions, including discussions of transient luminous events (sprites, sprite halos, jets, elves) and terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGF).  Two invited talks opened the session with an in depth introduction to the topics as well as presentations regarding the latest research on the modifications of the upper atmosphere due to lightning.  A contributed talk followed the invited talks.  The workshop ended with a well participated panel discussion on the interpretation of existing data and models.
<p>
The first invited talk consisted of two parts.  The first part was given by Dr. Matthew G. McHarg (USAF Academy).  He showed the most recent observations of sprites and their filamentary structures, streamers, using high speed ground-based imagery.  The 10,000 fps video observations support previous results that the onset altitude of sprites is about 75-80 km altitude and that the downward development of positive streamers precedes the upward propagation of negative streamers.  Emission rates in individual streamer heads are estimated to be in the range of 1021 to 1024 photons/s.  The second part was given by Takeshi Kammae (UAF).  He presented the spectra of emissions from sprite streamer heads at 10,000 fps.  A slitless spectrograph was utilized to obtain the spectra.  The reported spectra lack blue signatures from Nitrogen and Nitrogen ions.  The speaker suggested that this result is due to Rayleigh scattering because the sprite event is 650 km away from the observation site.
<p>
The second invited talk was given by Jingbo Li (Duke).  He conducted coordinated analysis of delayed sprites with high speed images and electromagnetic fields.  During a sprite campaign in the summer of 2005, about 50% of observed sprite events were delayed more than 10 ms after the lightning return stroke.  The phenomenological features of long-delayed sprites were presented, including the initiation altitude and charge moment change of the parent lightning discharges. The speaker reported simulation results of the electric field produced by lighting discharges using a 2-D FDTD model.  Comparison of the measurements and simulation results indicated that the slow intensification of lightning current plays an important role in sprite initiation for the long delayed sprites.
<p>
Dr. Nikolai Lehtinen (Stanford) reported Monte-Carlo simulation results for the propagation of gamma-rays through the atmosphere.  The model includes Compton scattering, photoelectric absorption, pair production and subsequent position annihilation process.  The speaker presented the conditions and constraints on the production of TGFs by analyzing the modeling results.
<p>
The panel discussion was very successful.  Questions regarding fundamental physics and characteristics of sprites were raised by the audience and answered by the panel of experts.  The importance of comparing the existing data with sprite streamer models was greatly appreciated during the discussion.  Further experimental exploration of sprite streamers is necessary to verify and validate of the modeling results.  The participants acknowledged the challenges of studying the chemical, thermal and electrical effects of lightning on the upper atmosphere.  Examples of re-ignition and long delayed sprites demonstrated that physical and chemical processes, which are triggered by lightning discharges, proceed with a much longer timescale than that of sprites in the mesosphere and lower ionosphere regions.  More investigations of those processes have to be carried out in future research.

Distributed Arrays of Small Instruments (DASI) Workshop
with conveners Maura Hagan, Michael Kelley, David Hysell, Rod Heelis, John Foster,
Eric Donovan, Cesar Valladares, Mark Moldwin, Melissa Meyer, and Jan Sojka
</h4>
<p><b>0800-1700 Friday 29 June Anasazi</b>
<a href="/workshop/archive/2007/agenda_2007.html" target="cedarweb_aux">
See Friday agenda</a>
<br>
The concept of
solving major science questions by deploying a network of small instruments was 
endorsed by the National Research Council's Space Studies Board in their report, 
The Sun to the Earth and Beyond:  A Decadal Research Strategy in Solar and Space 
Physics.  Under the leadership of John Foster, from this committee, a detailed 
report from a Woods Hole Workshop on DASI science was created.  The original 
DASI concept envisaged a single overarching entity with a high priority science 
question to be answered.  However, this has evolved, at Woods Hole it became 
evident that DASI means different realizations to different communities.  
Aeronomy is a case in point with key independent science questions from the 
mesosphere, D-region, E-region, thermosphere, F-region, topside, as well as M-I 
coupling that can only be addressed by multi-point measurements.
<p>
This workshop
provides a forum for these aeronomy communities to identify and discuss science 
questions and multi-point instrumentation schemes to address them.  This 
workshop builds on last years CEDAR 2006 Workshop Frontier Science Session where 
over 35 CEDAR science questions were summarized.  About 25 of these questions 
were, in essence, DASI science concepts that could be grouped into at least 3 
independent CEDAR topical areas.
<p>
The format of the workshop still evolves with
a broad outline that includes the following:
<ul>
<li>Involve and invite community
participation both formally and informally to discuss science questions that 
need DASI solutions.
<li>Advance the ideas presented last year in the CEDAR
Frontier Science Questions session.
<li>Hear lessons learned from present day
mini-DASI deployments.
<li>Strategize on how mini-DASI deployments and their
infrastructure can be leveraged to create the overarching DASI.
<li>Hear from International colleagues on deployment issues of DASI beyond the U.S.
<li>Invite NSF participation and input on time lines and realization strategies.
</ul><p>
The workshop provides an open forum for all CEDAR science questions that can
potentially be addressed by DASI.  For participation involvement, your 
suggestions, your willingness to present, or simply to be present, please 
contact one of the conveners with a copy to Jan Sojka (sojka@cc.usu.edu).
